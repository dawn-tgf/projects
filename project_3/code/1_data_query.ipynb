    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "To develop a classifier that can predict if a reddit user is suffering from depression, or has the tendency to commit suicide by classifying posts from two subreddit \"depression_help\" and \"SuicideWatch\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US.  According to the statistics from American foundation for Suicide Prevention, there are estimated 3836 suicide attempts per day in 2017. Suicide prevention is one way to combat the problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Depression usually develops before suicide. The purpose of this project is to create a NLP classifier that hopefully can distinguish someone with suicidal intents from depression by analyzing the words they say.  This is done by classifying posts from two Reddit subreddit \"depression_help\" and \"SuicideWatch\"  \n",
    "\n",
    " Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called \"subreddits\".  According to Alexa Internet, as of July 2019, Reddit ranks as the No. 5 most visited website in the U.S. and No. 13 in the world.  Subreddit \"SuicideWatch\" has 179K members, while \"depression_help\" has 47.3K members.  As their names suggest, these two subreddits are platforms where users with depression or suicidal thoughts could use to seek help.  Texts from these two subreddits form the dataset of this classifier project."

Maybe I just want to share a little bit of my story with someone before I vanish...  \\n\\n\\nI used to be a smart kid despite dyslexia, it took me a while to get the hang of reading and writing, but once I got it, I enjoyed it a lot. My father was an alcoholic and he would beat me to within an inch of life daily, so books and fantasy became my haven. I'm not trying to justify his actions, but I can't really blame him that much. My parents, they didn't want a son and once my mom got pregnant, they discovered she had a heart condition. She would spend the next 15 years in hospitals having surgery after surgery. I guess my dad didn't take it very well, they were a young couple in financial difficulties, then a newborn and such a serious medical condition, I'm sure this is likely to disturb anyone...  \\n\\n\\nFast forward some 17 years, I had finished high-school and all I wanted was to move out and not to get beaten every day. I still had a lot of anger inside of me, I was young and dumb. I pretty much never had a clear goal in my life so far. My friends used to talk about how they dreamed to become doctors, dentists, veterinarians and such, while all I ever wanted was to survive. Not sure if this is what really cause my complete lack of ambition or if I was already broken...  \\n\\n\\nDuring high-school I saved some money while going through lot of different odd jobs  and such. When I finally graduated I moved to the state's capital by myself. Some 200 miles away from my hometown that place was somewhat scary. My hometown had some 60,000 inhabitants and suddenly I was living in this metropolis surrounded by 12,000,000 people, it was a rush, I quickly found a place to stay and in less than a week I had a job. Not bad, I though to myself...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt didn't take long for me to meet a girl. She was a sweet little thing, we fell in love like the two dumb teenagers we were. She was a little older than me and she had a son already. A couple of months later I rented a house and she and her son moved in with me, we adopted some cats and we had a little garden. Those I think were the best months of my life. But good things don't seem to last and the company I was working for ended up going under and like that I saw myself staring at my over due bills...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThings were going real bad as I couldn't find another job and the money was running out. If I was alone, I probably could've pulled through, but now I had them to take care of, so I ended up joining the Marines so I could support them. I never saw myself as a military man until that, but we gotta do what we gotta do.  \\n\\n\\nI rather not to go in details about my service, except for the fact I spent four years deployed. It was around that time I first felt I was losing control over this darkness inside of me. In my last six months I couldn't even call her. I kept sending the checks, but I just couldn't bear talking to her... I had this weight upon my shoulders, I felt ashamed and dirty... I didn't even tell her when I came back, I just showed up at the front yard... I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't bring myself to knock on the door. It was raining as I stood there for some time, not sure how long, eventually the neighbors called the cops and she went out when they arrived...  \\n\\n\\nI remember feeling terrible as she hugged me and cried. I felt awkward and scared, not sure why, I just didn't feel at home. It felt like I was trying to fit into someone else's life... That's when the nightmares begun. They kept her up all night, it was horrible and eventually I moved out of the house... I told her I would keep paying the bills for them, but she just left...  \\n\\n\\nThat's when I got into drinking. I spent two years drenched in alcohol until one day I had a cardiac arrest due to alcohol poisoning... I tried to kill myself three times before that, but I ended up quitting because I was only hurting whoever still cared a little bit for me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThings actually didn't get any better after I quit. To be completely honest, it all got a lot worse after... Fast forward some years and I'm here... I am 30 years old, I'm barely making through between long time unemployment and some odd jobs, I'm earning enough to pay the rent and feed my cats even though sometimes I don't have food for myself, not that it matters anyway as I barely have any appetite. I can't keep any relationships, be it friends or girlfriends, I'm always alone. My house is covered in trash as I just can't bring myself to clean anything and I can't remember the last time I had a bath.  \\n\\n\\nI'm writing this right now because I didn't get any sleep in the last four days and I just needed to share this with someone. I'm not even sure if I'll actually post it or just delete it after I finish writing it, like I already did many times before... I feel embarrassed and scared all the time. Every morning I close my windows in shame and I sneak around my own house in fear my neighbors would realize I'm here. Every little noise I hear gets my mind racing, thinking about the police storming into my house because someone might have complained about the smell... I just feel like a complete failure, an embarrassment, I feel like I threw my life away and I just can't come back from all my bad decisions, but at the same time I feel this sickening despair flooding my brain to do something now...  \\n\\n\\nI try to do my best for my cats... I keep their litter box clean and I always get them the most expensive food, but the rest is completely abandoned... I feel like people would commit me to an institution if anyone saw they way I've been living and even knowing that I just don't have the strength to do anything about it... Countless times I started to gather all the trash and cleaning the house just to collapse on the trash and lie there... Sometimes I even manage to, but then I feel too embarrassed to throw all that trash out and end up exposing myself like that...  \\n\\n\\nIt's been some long years since I last tried to kill myself, but lately, I'm feeling like I'm getting cornered more and more each day. I feel like I don't have any other options and I really don't know if I'll get through this time... I just don't feel sad anymore, I can't cry, I can't eat or sleep...  \\n\\n\\nIt's been half-an-hour since I finished typing this and I decided to post it... I'm very sorry if this made you feel sad in anyway, it was not my intention, but for some unknown reason I just needed to share it with someone. I'm very tired and broken and this may well be the last opportunity I have to share my story with someone and for some reason, I belive I deserve at least that.  \\n\\n\\nI also do it in the hope someone may find some comfort or understanding of what I went through and maybe use it for the betterment of one's life...  \\n\\n\\nI'm truly sorry and I wish you all the happiness in the world\",\n",

       "       'selftext': 'Went on 4 dates with a girl I met on a dating app then on the last date she started to fade away throught text replying with short anwers, taking longer than she use to, also not texting 1st.When I text her saying hey are you not interested anymore if it is that let me know but left me on read.Little info she is 10 years older than me, Im 23 male,she said she likes younger guys also said she wanted a relationship but the way she was acting kept making me believe she wanted sex, cause she sent me nudes without me asking on our 1st videocall she teased me,on the dates she kept talking about sex,on the 3rd date she mention that she wanted to see my penis in flaccid state while I was in her car, another thing she said that in order to be in a relationship with her we needed to have sex a few times to see how I make her feel in bed and also go out with her a little more to public places to see how I would react when she begins to have a panic attack in public, but for some reason kept making me wait,on the very 1st dates she was telling me she suffered from panic attacks,anxiety,ocd and because of that depression.Also on the 1st 3 dates she was the one who invited me out and also the one who pay on the dates.The last one it was me.\\n\\nBut here is when things get weird, since we stopped texting she was barely entering the places were she use to chat with me, the main ones were whatsapp and snapchat I\\'m talking about days without being online, she did watched my stories on snapchat from time to time,also everytime I sent her a picture of me on snapchat she would saved or a long message she would saved even after she ghosted me,she doesnt usually save our snapchat convos.When she does gets online is only very late at night and for a few minutes also most of the time not all the time but most when she text with me she always replied late at night like at 4 am.She blocked me from her phone number but not on all the other places were we chatted the most, we actually never text or call through phone number it was always on whatsapp.She doesnt have social media but 2 weeks after she stopped replying she made a private IG and posted some pics in which one of the pics it was a picture she sent me earlier when we 1st started texting were she is in her bed showing her ass and also put and adreess that it seems it looks like is her house.And that\\'s very weird to me, also that IG that she made it looks like she doesnt enter there that much either.\\n\\nAnother thing most of the pictures that she post are old pictures and it looks like they are pictures taken from another phone like she took another phone to take a picture of the screen of the other phone were the picture is, weird I suggest.She is by far the weirdiest and most mysterious female I have dated.Another thing she lives with her parents and said she had 4 abortions, never been married and she doesnt wanna have kids cause that would make her anxiety worse.It looks like she likes to have sex a lot cause she talked about that a lot with me in dates.Doesnt have any friends male or female.Doesnt like kissing on the mouth even tho I made her do it.Now almost a month had pass since last time I sent her a message and I sent her a message on whatsapp days ago it was a picture saying Happy New Year but the reason I sent this it was to verify if she had me on her contacts cause I know a function on whatsapp to verify that.You sent a message through a group and if the person saw the message it means they have you on their contacts.\\n\\nShe saw it ignored it but reply like 7 hours later reply with a thank you,then I text her again saying if something happen to her and she said \"you know why I\\'m like this, we already talk about this.I thought you understood me\" I know she was talking about her depression etc.She started replying to me again after ghosting me for a month.I told her I understood her but I did not undertand why she became distant with me in just 2 days and she said \" Im like that,I told you\" then I ask her are you bipolar and she said \"no, if you dont understand me then why keep talking\" I said I understand I just wanna know you more and she said doesnt look like it, now she is replying to me again but her answers are kind of cold like last time, leaves me on read sometimes but I text her again and she keeps replying and is not texting 1st but atleast she is replying but I dont know if I should believe her if that was really the reason why she ghosted me.I mean I believe her that she suffer from all that she showed me the pills she was taking for her mental illness and kept talking about it and she does have a lot signs of someone not mentally alright but I\\'m not really sure.I have not invited her out yet now but I feel like she is gonna say no or leave me on read again or she might say yes I\\'m not really sure. \\n\\nMy question is if she not interested,why she doesn\\'t just tell me and that\\'s it, I have told her if it is that she simply can just say it that is not gonna harm me at all is just gonna save me time but the last time I told her that she ignore that message,why replying to me after a month, why she keeps watching my stories, why she doesnt delete me from any other place or  keeping me in her phone number contacts?',\n",

       "       'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Went on 4 dates with a girl I met on a dating app then on the last date she started to fade away throught text replying with short anwers, taking longer than she use to, also not texting 1st.When I text her saying hey are you not interested anymore if it is that let me know but left me on read.Little info she is 10 years older than me, Im 23 male,she said she likes younger guys also said she wanted a relationship but the way she was acting kept making me believe she wanted sex, cause she sent me nudes without me asking on our 1st videocall she teased me,on the dates she kept talking about sex,on the 3rd date she mention that she wanted to see my penis in flaccid state while I was in her car, another thing she said that in order to be in a relationship with her we needed to have sex a few times to see how I make her feel in bed and also go out with her a little more to public places to see how I would react when she begins to have a panic attack in public, but for some reason kept making me wait,on the very 1st dates she was telling me she suffered from panic attacks,anxiety,ocd and because of that depression.Also on the 1st 3 dates she was the one who invited me out and also the one who pay on the dates.The last one it was me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But here is when things get weird, since we stopped texting she was barely entering the places were she use to chat with me, the main ones were whatsapp and snapchat I&amp;#39;m talking about days without being online, she did watched my stories on snapchat from time to time,also everytime I sent her a picture of me on snapchat she would saved or a long message she would saved even after she ghosted me,she doesnt usually save our snapchat convos.When she does gets online is only very late at night and for a few minutes also most of the time not all the time but most when she text with me she always replied late at night like at 4 am.She blocked me from her phone number but not on all the other places were we chatted the most, we actually never text or call through phone number it was always on whatsapp.She doesnt have social media but 2 weeks after she stopped replying she made a private IG and posted some pics in which one of the pics it was a picture she sent me earlier when we 1st started texting were she is in her bed showing her ass and also put and adreess that it seems it looks like is her house.And that&amp;#39;s very weird to me, also that IG that she made it looks like she doesnt enter there that much either.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing most of the pictures that she post are old pictures and it looks like they are pictures taken from another phone like she took another phone to take a picture of the screen of the other phone were the picture is, weird I suggest.She is by far the weirdiest and most mysterious female I have dated.Another thing she lives with her parents and said she had 4 abortions, never been married and she doesnt wanna have kids cause that would make her anxiety worse.It looks like she likes to have sex a lot cause she talked about that a lot with me in dates.Doesnt have any friends male or female.Doesnt like kissing on the mouth even tho I made her do it.Now almost a month had pass since last time I sent her a message and I sent her a message on whatsapp days ago it was a picture saying Happy New Year but the reason I sent this it was to verify if she had me on her contacts cause I know a function on whatsapp to verify that.You sent a message through a group and if the person saw the message it means they have you on their contacts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She saw it ignored it but reply like 7 hours later reply with a thank you,then I text her again saying if something happen to her and she said &amp;quot;you know why I&amp;#39;m like this, we already talk about this.I thought you understood me&amp;quot; I know she was talking about her depression etc.She started replying to me again after ghosting me for a month.I told her I understood her but I did not undertand why she became distant with me in just 2 days and she said &amp;quot; Im like that,I told you&amp;quot; then I ask her are you bipolar and she said &amp;quot;no, if you dont understand me then why keep talking&amp;quot; I said I understand I just wanna know you more and she said doesnt look like it, now she is replying to me again but her answers are kind of cold like last time, leaves me on read sometimes but I text her again and she keeps replying and is not texting 1st but atleast she is replying but I dont know if I should believe her if that was really the reason why she ghosted me.I mean I believe her that she suffer from all that she showed me the pills she was taking for her mental illness and kept talking about it and she does have a lot signs of someone not mentally alright but I&amp;#39;m not really sure.I have not invited her out yet now but I feel like she is gonna say no or leave me on read again or she might say yes I&amp;#39;m not really sure. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My question is if she not interested,why she doesn&amp;#39;t just tell me and that&amp;#39;s it, I have told her if it is that she simply can just say it that is not gonna harm me at all is just gonna save me time but the last time I told her that she ignore that message,why replying to me after a month, why she keeps watching my stories, why she doesnt delete me from any other place or  keeping me in her phone number contacts?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I went to uni when I was 18 and again I struggled to make friends at first but in my final year I finally felt included by a good group of friends for the first time in my life.\\n\\nI had problems with depression through my teenage years and anxiety from childhood. At uni my anxiety got a whole lot worse. When I was 21 and graduated, I moved back home, where my parents pressured me into doing an internship straight away even though I was ill. I burned out and had my first complete mental breakdown. After that, it became a cycle of short term jobs and breakdowns. I managed to live independently for over 2 years but then I had to move back in with my parents for practical and financial reasons. They're retired and my mum is disabled so they value having me around to help, even though they can be quite critical of me at times. \\n\\nIn the past few years I've done some temporary jobs and right now I have some work I can do from home and some self employed work. My mental health is much more stable but I'm earning less than half of what I earned working full time as I work less than 20 hours most weeks. But as I'm living with my parents I've got enough money for the things I want to do. \\n\\nIn my home town most of the people I know I've met through mental health services and most of them don't work, so I don't feel weird about not having a proper job. \\n\\nI still see some of the friends I made at uni but I find it difficult because they all earn a lot more than me and they've got their own homes. I feel like I've got stuck where they were 9-10 years ago.  When we meet up they talk about stuff like bills, appliances and interior design. I'm still sleeping in the same room I've had since I was 10, which is a mess because I've got more stuff than I can fit in one room. \\n\\nI feel like when I used to play Mario Kart Wii with my friends at uni and I was really bad at it at first, so I'd end up driving the wrong way and getting lapped. I feel like I've been lapped and I'm watching my friends move further and further ahead of me. \\n\\nI know the theory about not comparing myself to others and I know they will be struggling under the surface with life too. But I can't shake the feelings of shame at my situation when I'm with my friends and it makes me almost not want to see them. I feel ashamed telling new people that I live with my parents, too. But I can't see a way out because I'm not capable of holding down a proper job.\",\n",

I just feel like no one well listen and when ever I try to reach out he says that I’m ridiculous and he threatens to take what I brought using the money from my part time job. I just feel like he’ll never be proud. Sometimes I think about ending it all I think if he will even miss me or care that I am gone. Even when I walk away he will come after me and tell me to cone back inside and join the family I just say I need some time alone and that I need to think. He always ask me to tell him what he’s doing wrong but when ever try he just yells, so now all I say is I’m not comfortable sharing but he still gets mad. I don’t know whether I should go to the school counsellor because if he finds out he’ll be mad. He doesn’t physically hurt me and I don’t know if he means to hurt me I just don’t know what to do with myself.',\n",

I just feel like no one well listen and when ever I try to reach out he says that I’m ridiculous and he threatens to take what I brought using the money from my part time job. I just feel like he’ll never be proud. Sometimes I think about ending it all I think if he will even miss me or care that I am gone. Even when I walk away he will come after me and tell me to cone back inside and join the family I just say I need some time alone and that I need to think. He always ask me to tell him what he’s doing wrong but when ever try he just yells, so now all I say is I’m not comfortable sharing but he still gets mad. I don’t know whether I should go to the school counsellor because if he finds out he’ll be mad. He doesn’t physically hurt me and I don’t know if he means to hurt me I just don’t know what to do with myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I started feeling unsure about the relationship but as I was having these thoughts, my SO had some major health scares. This triggered my anxiety but I tried to be supportive while concealing how I was feeling all the while feeling extremely guilty for the second thoughts I had about dating my SO. I decided to start seeing a psychologist for the first time in 2 years, and told my SO about how I was feeling and asked for some space for the time being. While it was helpful to just lay out my thoughts and inner struggles out during therapy, I still have a lot to unpack and some days I just feel so hopeless and dark, feeling like I just don’t want to keep going and living. I still wake up with guilt for asking for space essentially a “break” and the fear of hurting my SO and losing a friendship not just a relationship if I do decide to end things officially. I know these thoughts aren’t good and maybe they’re temporary and therapy can help but I don’t know what to do in the meantime between my next session. I’m honestly becoming scared of what I’m capable of doing as my thoughts become increasingly dark. \\n\\nWhat do you do during those times when you find your mind going to a really bad dark place but you don’t have therapy for the next week or so/friends to talk it out with?',\n",

       "     'selftext': '(Cw suicide mention and self harm) \\n\\nMy depression was out of control the last 3 weeks. It comes in cycles and I may not have the proper diagnosis. \\n\\nThis time it was so bad that 3 weeks ago I put a lighter to my arm in places until I couldn\\'t anymore. I\\'d had a panic attack and could not calm down despite my prescription Klonopin. \\n\\nThursday night, I wanted to do this again before I healed and got an unexpected call from my mother. We don\\'t talk much about my mental health, but we live 2 hours away, so we see each other a lot, so she sees my cycles of highs and lows. I was sobbing and word vomited about my constant suicidal ideation eating at my brain. I am always aware the thoughts are irrational, but they are overwhelming. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this coming Monday, but we agreed to meet halfway at a good hospital the next morning. Screw work, I need to get my head on straight! I begged her to let me sleep in since I\\'d been sleep deprived for weeks and she agreed that I would call her in the morning. We made plans for me to come stay at home for a while so I can get better. I\\'ve been battling this since I was 7 years old, and I am 23 now! I want to be happy, so I thought \"Hell yeah! Let\\'s get my brain working right this time!\"\\n\\nI woke up at 7:30ish AM to banging on the door. My roommate\\'s boyfriend assumed it was our annoying neighbor. Banging again. I put on some sweatpants and look in the peep hole and it\\'s the police! \"Are you Casey xXxX?\" they ask. My heart sank. I tell them to come on inside and they explained they had a distress call. I let them into my bedroom and look at my phone to see so many missed calls from my worried mother. While they were in my room, I call her and say \"WHY DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?!\" but she was sobbing and scared and worried for me. \\n\\nI had to cooperate and let them take me through a back entrance to some emergency room type deal to be mentally evaluated. I thanked them for my first ride in a cop car. I got temporarily locked in a room where I called and broke up with my absolutely unsupportive boyfriend. I let a few close friends know what was up. \\n\\nAfter a mental evaluation, I was thrown in a taxi with no idea where I was going. I had to ask a staff member 3 times where I would be so my parents (who were high tailing it to see me) could know where I was going. I get dropped off with no clue where to go in this dirty rehab facility. The staff were rude and the amazing cleaning staffwoman helped me find where to go and comforted me more than any counselor. \\n\\nI went inside to see what the deal about being admitted was. More rules than a prison. No personal belongings - not even my music. I didn\\'t have my books with me or any belongings. Forced group therapy (I HATE GROUP THERAPY). I refused and got an attitude from the staff lady. I walked into the lobby and just cried and waited on my parents to take me home. A doctor of sorts gave me a juice to take my medicine since I hadn\\'t eaten or drank all day and it was almost 1 PM at this point. \\n\\nWhen my parents finally arrived, we got ahold of a place who will do inpatient-outpatient care! We went to pack a bag for me, and my roommate is lovingly taking care of my cat. I start Monday. Alongside psychiatry, I hope they have some kind of therapy that isn\\'t the norm. I will chat for a bit, but I\\'ve dreamt of art or music therapy. I want to create. I cook to calm my soul. I can\\'t be locked in a room like the woman from the Yellow Wallpaper. It\\'s not for me. \\n\\nSo wish me luck as I start a new and different journey of intense treatment. My parents are being very helpful and supportive. My mom was extremely apologetic about the police. Living with them is very stressful and we are setting major boundaries. I\\'m going to move back to my hometown in my own little place once I am feeling better and can get a job where I excel (I\\'ve been job hopping badly through these cycles). I might be able to finish up my degree at the local tech school, too! I\\'ve also given up alcohol until March or April - I don\\'t have a drinking problem, just not allowing anything to make things worse. Only healthy foods and yoga every day is happening. I feel very hopeful. I still have that voice tugging at me and crying spells, but it\\'s going to get better. I am going to get better!!!!!!!\\n\\nAny advice about how to deal with therapy (I really hated CBT and group therapy) would be great. I\\'ve only ever been to a psychiatrist and a few therapy/counseling sessions for the last 3 years. Or, I\\'d also love advice on the situation in general. Let\\'s get better together, everyone!',\n",

It comes in cycles and I may not have the proper diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time it was so bad that 3 weeks ago I put a lighter to my arm in places until I couldn&amp;#39;t anymore. I&amp;#39;d had a panic attack and could not calm down despite my prescription Klonopin. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thursday night, I wanted to do this again before I healed and got an unexpected call from my mother. We don&amp;#39;t talk much about my mental health, but we live 2 hours away, so we see each other a lot, so she sees my cycles of highs and lows. I was sobbing and word vomited about my constant suicidal ideation eating at my brain. I am always aware the thoughts are irrational, but they are overwhelming. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this coming Monday, but we agreed to meet halfway at a good hospital the next morning. Screw work, I need to get my head on straight! I begged her to let me sleep in since I&amp;#39;d been sleep deprived for weeks and she agreed that I would call her in the morning. We made plans for me to come stay at home for a while so I can get better. I&amp;#39;ve been battling this since I was 7 years old, and I am 23 now! I want to be happy, so I thought &amp;quot;Hell yeah! Let&amp;#39;s get my brain working right this time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 7:30ish AM to banging on the door. My roommate&amp;#39;s boyfriend assumed it was our annoying neighbor. Banging again. I put on some sweatpants and look in the peep hole and it&amp;#39;s the police! &amp;quot;Are you Casey xXxX?&amp;quot; they ask. My heart sank. I tell them to come on inside and they explained they had a distress call. I let them into my bedroom and look at my phone to see so many missed calls from my worried mother. While they were in my room, I call her and say &amp;quot;WHY DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?!&amp;quot; but she was sobbing and scared and worried for me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had to cooperate and let them take me through a back entrance to some emergency room type deal to be mentally evaluated.
