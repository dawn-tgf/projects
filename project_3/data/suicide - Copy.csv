###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I'm not asking anyone to read any of this or even comment anything. I'm sorry anyway. I don't even know why I'm doing this. 

I've been depressed for so long. Only this year did I get help. Couldn't open up to the doctor about constant suicidal feelings and urges to self harm so they prescribed me prozac 20mg. After being this close to killing myself they raised the dose to prozac 40mg. They can't prescribe different meds until I try the higher dose. The meds don't fucking work.

I have been so fucking lonely for so long. I am in constant fear of being abandoned. I crave genuine connections but why tf would anyone want to form one with me. I am always scared people I care for will leave me. I am so touch starved. This girl seemed interested in me and texted me first, which has never happened ever. I was thinking about her constantly and already thinking about laying down my life for this person. I almost immediately descended into a deeper spiral of depression, constant urge to self harm. I just want to dig a fucking blade in me and let the blood run out. I realised I don't have actual feelings for this person, I just wanted someone to temporarily get rid of my loneliness. I dont have feelings at all. There's literally nothing inside me except misery. 

I can't see myself making it through this year. Or this month. I wish I lived in the USA so I could get a gun and blow my fucking brains out. I wish I never wake up so I don't have to deal with tomorrow and endure this messed up life

I have let everyone down. I wasted potential.

I feel like an attention grabbing selfish fuck. I was never abused as a child. I have been very lucky in many ways. And yet I am constantly wishing I have a heart attack or aneurysm and just drop dead. How can i say I feel like this when people have lived incredibly difficult lives? I am deceiving my ""friends"" by hiding my depression behind a stupid fake personality. I don't even know what my acual personality is as I've been depressed for so long it is just me.

No energy. Just lying on the floor and crying uncontrollably. Or sitting around feeling nothing. It would be so much better if I was dead. I keep thinking if I'm gonna kill myself, I'll kill myself tonight. But it never happens, im such a coward. There is no way out, i ruined my chances and I'll spend the rest of my life working minimum wage because i cant study.

I've been self harming for years and have had suicidal thoughts since the age of 9/10. I just wish I wasn't born. Someone please just come and shoot me. I can't make it to tomorrow. I don't want to even try. That makes me sound like such a stupid pussy

why am i even bothering to write this

If I don't kill myself sometime this year I will definitely do it as soon as my mum dies

And yet I am constantly wishing I have a heart attack or aneurysm and just drop dead. How can i say I feel like this when people have lived incredibly difficult lives? I am deceiving my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; by hiding my depression behind a stupid fake personality. I don&amp;#39;t even know what my acual personality is as I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for so long it is just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No energy. Just lying on the floor and crying uncontrollably. Or sitting around feeling nothing. It would be so much better if I was dead. I keep thinking if I&amp;#39;m gonna kill myself, I&amp;#39;ll kill myself tonight. But it never happens, im such a coward. There is no way out, i ruined my chances and I&amp;#39;ll spend the rest of my life working minimum wage because i cant study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been self harming for years and have had suicidal thoughts since the age of 9/10. I just wish I wasn&amp;#39;t born. Someone please just come and shoot me. I can&amp;#39;t make it to tomorrow. I don&amp;#39;t want to even try. That makes me sound like such a stupid pussy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why am i even bothering to write this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t kill myself sometime this year I will definitely do it as soon as my mum dies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I alive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing to offer people. I&amp;#39;m boring and socially anxious and I have nothing interesting to add. Just a fucking creep. People will be glad when I&amp;#39;m gone. I&amp;#39;m not going to try anymore as I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be around much longer. Whats the point&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I want to commit suicide. There is no question about it. The only reason for hesitation is that I don't want to hurt the people who I love. I've been suicidal for the vast majority of my life, including childhood. It doesn't feel like an easier feeling to deal with as time goes on. It primarily gets harder.

But I'm in a city with no friends and a SO who is usually busy. I feel completely and utterly alone. I don't know if I have ever felt this horrible in my life. I've been suicidal for most of it, but now I am seriously at the end of my rope.

I want to talk about it with my therapist, but I can't handle the trauma of being hospitalized for the 6th time. I know that if I was completely honest, I would undoubtedly be locked up. The 5th time was primarily dissociation and flashbacks, so I honestly think it would do more harm than good.

Oh, and I have officially failed at my career goals and had to give that up. So that's cool. I'm too dysfunctional to handle that career path. Now I'm too dysfunctional to handle basic tasks. I can't pretend I feel okay about it. Even eating is challenging.

It also hurts a bit to know that the only time my parents are capable of showing me genuine compassion is when I'm in crisis. I don't know whether it feels good or bad honestly. It feels good to have my abusive parents care about me, but it hurts that me hardcore wanting to be dead is the one and only time they show compassion.

I can't find joy in anything. I try getting out. I try doing activities I used to enjoy. I'd rather do nothing and feel terrible than do something that should be enjoyable and feel even more terrible.

I'm certainly a danger to myself, but I WILL NOT let myself be hospitalized again. That would be more than I can bear and would likely only make things worse. Is there an alternate option that isn't super expensive?

Edit: Also I feel it is worth listing my diagnoses. The main two are Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder (mostly caused by abusive parents and then made worse by other abuse).

,SuicideWatch,"So... not quite sure how to start one of these. This is my first post on Reddit. I usually just lurk around subreddits without posting anything. Heck, I made this account just to make this post.

I should start by saying that I'm very aware of how lucky I am compared to a lot of people in the world. I don't have any family or bullying issues, and for the most part my life is pretty much the opposite of a struggle. I'm seriously grateful for all the support and love I've received from my family throughout my twenty-odd years of life. I get along with them great, and we all share the same wonky sense of humour. I still live with my parents and siblings (I'm the oldest). I even recently got my first part-time job and I would like to eventually move out into a nice small apartment somewhere. 

My friends used to say I was the funny one in the group. I remember in secondary school, my BFF was asked why she was friends with me and she said that I was the funniest person she knows. It's sad to say, but I'm definitely one of those people who ""peaked in highschool"". Although I wasn't one of the ""popular kids"", I was well known in my year group. Almost all of the teachers knew me by name, and I loved my conversations with them. I consistently won student awards, and my grades were pretty nice too. I was pretty good at sports and took part in any sports clubs I could. My group of friends was amazing. We did so much together. We were all different, and had totally different interests, but that's what made us work so well together. There was never a dull moment with that lot. 

I remember, things started to feel different in my last year of secondary school. I can't tell what changed, but all of a sudden my emotions didn't really feel quite right. I still laughed and smiled as usual, but it felt like I actually had to consciously put some effort in. I wouldn't say I felt sad. I'm not sure how I would describe it, but it's like I couldn't get too emotional about much of anything.

I started missing more school around then. I started going to clubs less too. Not sure why, but I just couldn't get motivated to go sometimes. It's weird, because I had my friends, and my teachers there. I liked the subjects I was studying, and I was still doing well grades-wise. Sometimes, I'd fake an illness to get out of going in for a couple of days here or there. A couple of times, I tripped over on purpose just to get out because of a ""sore ankle"" or something. That way, it didn't seem like I was sick all the time. I made sure not to be too absent though - didn't want people to start getting super worried about my health.

I finished secondary school with good grades and started college not long after. Everything seemed pretty cool up until I started my second year. Things were looking up. Almost all of my friends went to the same college, and I still kept in touch with the ones who didn't for a while. For some reason, I started getting sick for realsies, and quite often. I found that I couldn't concentrate properly. I found myself zoning out a lot. My friends and I didn't have as much of a chance to interact with eachother due to our timetables, and I found that I smiled less and less as the days went by. I got so sick and weak that I actually had to drop out of my second year of college and redo it a year later. Even after that, my concentration didn't seem to improve. As you would expect, my grades suffered. I couldn't really concentrate in the exams, but I managed to barely pass all of my A-Levels. When I received my results in the mail, I was just like, ""Huh, I see"". My parents seemed upset, but I just couldn't feel sad about it. I played it off with a smile. I was happy that I didn't fail.

I procrastinated when it came to my university application, and decided that I'd put it off for a year. A gap year sounded like a good idea. My parents agreed, so I became a NEET. I just stayed at home all day, playing the occasional videogame or reading books. I watched anime too. Every now and then I'd go out to the local park and sit on a bench or a swing and listen to music.

I lost touch with my friends. I already stopped using social media, so we usually kept in touch via text/calls. I started responding to them less and less. It got to the point where I actually lied to my best friend about having a job at the local mall, just so she wouldn't worry about me. Eventually we didn't talk at all. For the most part I feel it's for the best. I know it's really selfish, but I felt kinda useless and lazy, and I didn't want my friends to have to put up with me. 

A year had passed, and I still didn't really feel motivated to go back into education just yet. I decided to actually look for a job instead of sitting around, twiddling my thumbs. I signed up with the local job centre too, and got busy. Every job I applied for rejected me, and that's understandable given the current job market.

While searching for employment, I started a course that was supposed to boost my employability and soft skills. Through that course, I made a lot of new friends. We still keep in touch from time to time, but I can't help but feel like I'm dragging them down. I don't know why, but every time people start to depend on me, it kinda stresses me out. I get worried that I'm not as good as they think I am. What if they realise that I'm not as happy as I let on? What if they really get to know me properly and realise that they've wasted their time on me?

A few months ago I got my current job as a part time retail worker. The pay is minimum wage, but it's enough to help my parents out and pay for my hobbies. I get along pretty well with all of my co-workers. I hit all of my targets. I try to make sure the customers are as happy and comfortable as possible. I'd say I'm pretty good at my job for the most part. There are times when I really feel how strained my smiles are. I laugh along with my coworkers and customers, and I make sure I have a pleasant demeanor, but sometimes it feels like it takes just a bit too much effort. Sometimes I'll have a great sales day, and then I'll start worrying. What if they expect this level of performance from now on? I'm not sure if I can live up to those kinds of expectations sometimes.

A month ago, I finally applied for university. I'm pretty good with computers for the most part, and I'm good at maths, so I figured I'd apply for a computer science degree (with a foundation year as I've been out of education for a couple of years now). I had already been learning java in my spare time for a few months. I picked my five uni choices, and sent off my application. For the first time in a while I was actually kinda pleased with myself.

Yesterday morning I received two rejection emails. Honestly, I didn't even feel disappointed. It's strange, but I don't really feel that bad now either. I want to tell my parents, but honestly I don't want to see their reactions. I'm sure they will be disappointed in me. I should feel disappointed too, but I just feel empty.

I feel like lately there are two me's. There's the me that laughs and smiles and puts and effort into the things they do. Then there's the empty me that nobody sees. 

Sometimes when I'm alone I just lie down and do nothing at all. Sometimes I think about how I'm a waste of space and resources. Part of me is sure that my family thinks I'm a failure. I know I do. Im stuck. I feel like I'm walking, but I'm always in the same place no matter how fast I move my legs. No matter what I do, I can't change who I am as a person. I think about how easy it would be to die. My family might be sad for a while sure, but I'm sure they'd get over me eventually. On the plus side, I wouldn't be taking up so much space in our small house. I kinda feel guilty for being alive. I've had so many opportunities and I've let them all slip through my fingers. Opportunities that other people would've been so grateful for.",t2_5js73gxd,False,,0,False,I'm a waste,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,False,t3_evd7ev,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580280591.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... not quite sure how to start one of these. This is my first post on Reddit. I usually just lurk around subreddits without posting anything. Heck, I made this account just to make this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should start by saying that I&amp;#39;m very aware of how lucky I am compared to a lot of people in the world. I don&amp;#39;t have any family or bullying issues, and for the most part my life is pretty much the opposite of a struggle. I&amp;#39;m seriously grateful for all the support and love I&amp;#39;ve received from my family throughout my twenty-odd years of life. I get along with them great, and we all share the same wonky sense of humour. I still live with my parents and siblings (I&amp;#39;m the oldest). I even recently got my first part-time job and I would like to eventually move out into a nice small apartment somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends used to say I was the funny one in the group. I remember in secondary school, my BFF was asked why she was friends with me and she said that I was the funniest person she knows. It&amp;#39;s sad to say, but I&amp;#39;m definitely one of those people who &amp;quot;peaked in highschool&amp;quot;. Although I wasn&amp;#39;t one of the &amp;quot;popular kids&amp;quot;, I was well known in my year group. Almost all of the teachers knew me by name, and I loved my conversations with them. I consistently won student awards, and my grades were pretty nice too. I was pretty good at sports and took part in any sports clubs I could. My group of friends was amazing. We did so much together. We were all different, and had totally different interests, but that&amp;#39;s what made us work so well together. There was never a dull moment with that lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember, things started to feel different in my last year of secondary school. I can&amp;#39;t tell what changed, but all of a sudden my emotions didn&amp;#39;t really feel quite right. I still laughed and smiled as usual, but it felt like I actually had to consciously put some effort in. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I felt sad. I&amp;#39;m not sure how I would describe it, but it&amp;#39;s like I couldn&amp;#39;t get too emotional about much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started missing more school around then. I started going to clubs less too. Not sure why, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t get motivated to go sometimes. It&amp;#39;s weird, because I had my friends, and my teachers there. I liked the subjects I was studying, and I was still doing well grades-wise. Sometimes, I&amp;#39;d fake an illness to get out of going in for a couple of days here or there. A couple of times, I tripped over on purpose just to get out because of a &amp;quot;sore ankle&amp;quot; or something. That way, it didn&amp;#39;t seem like I was sick all the time. I made sure not to be too absent though - didn&amp;#39;t want people to start getting super worried about my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished secondary school with good grades and started college not long after. Everything seemed pretty cool up until I started my second year. Things were looking up. Almost all of my friends went to the same college, and I still kept in touch with the ones who didn&amp;#39;t for a while. For some reason, I started getting sick for realsies, and quite often. I found that I couldn&amp;#39;t concentrate properly. I found myself zoning out a lot. My friends and I didn&amp;#39;t have as much of a chance to interact with eachother due to our timetables, and I found that I smiled less and less as the days went by. I got so sick and weak that I actually had to drop out of my second year of college and redo it a year later. Even after that, my concentration didn&amp;#39;t seem to improve. As you would expect, my grades suffered. I couldn&amp;#39;t really concentrate in the exams, but I managed to barely pass all of my A-Levels. When I received my results in the mail, I was just like, &amp;quot;Huh, I see&amp;quot;. My parents seemed upset, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t feel sad about it. I played it off with a smile. I was happy that I didn&amp;#39;t fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I procrastinated when it came to my university application, and decided that I&amp;#39;d put it off for a year. A gap year sounded like a good idea. My parents agreed, so I became a NEET. I just stayed at home all day, playing the occasional videogame or reading books. I watched anime too. Every now and then I&amp;#39;d go out to the local park and sit on a bench or a swing and listen to music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost touch with my friends. I already stopped using social media, so we usually kept in touch via text/calls. I started responding to them less and less. It got to the point where I actually lied to my best friend about having a job at the local mall, just so she wouldn&amp;#39;t worry about me. Eventually we didn&amp;#39;t talk at all. For the most part I feel it&amp;#39;s for the best. I know it&amp;#39;s really selfish, but I felt kinda useless and lazy, and I didn&amp;#39;t want my friends to have to put up with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year had passed, and I still didn&amp;#39;t really feel motivated to go back into education just yet. I decided to actually look for a job instead of sitting around, twiddling my thumbs. I signed up with the local job centre too, and got busy. Every job I applied for rejected me, and that&amp;#39;s understandable given the current job market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While searching for employment, I started a course that was supposed to boost my employability and soft skills. Through that course, I made a lot of new friends. We still keep in touch from time to time, but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel like I&amp;#39;m dragging them down. I don&amp;#39;t know why, but every time people start to depend on me, it kinda stresses me out. I get worried that I&amp;#39;m not as good as they think I am. What if they realise that I&amp;#39;m not as happy as I let on? What if they really get to know me properly and realise that they&amp;#39;ve wasted their time on me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I got my current job as a part time retail worker. The pay is minimum wage, but it&amp;#39;s enough to help my parents out and pay for my hobbies. I get along pretty well with all of my co-workers. I hit all of my targets. I try to make sure the customers are as happy and comfortable as possible. I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m pretty good at my job for the most part. There are times when I really feel how strained my smiles are. I laugh along with my coworkers and customers, and I make sure I have a pleasant demeanor, but sometimes it feels like it takes just a bit too much effort. Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll have a great sales day, and then I&amp;#39;ll start worrying. What if they expect this level of performance from now on? I&amp;#39;m not sure if I can live up to those kinds of expectations sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month ago, I finally applied for university. I&amp;#39;m pretty good with computers for the most part, and I&amp;#39;m good at maths, so I figured I&amp;#39;d apply for a computer science degree (with a foundation year as I&amp;#39;ve been out of education for a couple of years now).

And I wish you could visit your parents’ grave someday. To Joyce and Nigel, thank you for letting me crash into your place. Thank you for always checking up on me. Thank you for taking care of me at the times that I couldn’t take care of myself. I wish both of you will achieve your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a 15 years old boy and I will start it from the beginning of everything.
I have a twin brother and since my childhood I feel like I am his shadow, he is more handsome, funnier, and literally better in anything than me, when I used to be bullyed because of the way I look, my ears and being a totally freak, he was my only friend and the only one who helped me, so I think I putted all the love i myself in him and I dont will never ever love me, so that self love bs do not work with me at all.
In 2018 I was at a toxic relationship and I was in so much fear because if I said anything that that she didnt like it, she would send me pics with her wrist slit or chest, and I feel like I couldnt be me and I just wanted to end it, but I was so afraid of me being the one who made her suicide and I kept going and going with it, but eventually I broke up with her but now she is fine and I was just being played all the time, so I lost the hability to trust people. We broke up in December, 2018.
When 2019 came, I changed school, lost all my friends and was just in a bad phase, so i the ehen the first day of class ended, I tried to kill myself with my father's gun, so I loaded that shit, aimed to my face face I couldnt pull the trigger because my brother would be the one who would find my empty body and this was unfair with him.
After that day I tried to improve my life, study hard, go to the gym and this kind of stuff, but once my mother said that I would be better off dead and that her life would be better if I hadnt be born and because of that, I think of suicide 99% of my life.

In summer my girlfriend kill herself over real life issue and online issue. I was bothered and turn to alcohol and drug. I meet a very kind man who knew my girlfriend online who ran a few community my girlfriend had been part of who very much help me through that time. They devote a lot of time and energy in helping me recover.

The man who help me is good smart man who want to help people but I think people take advantage of that. Now he also hurting and I want to help but I am running out of idea.

I like to go over what happen so people can understand. Over month ago this man was apparently voted out of group running community he love and group then say very mean things about him in front of everyone. Man have had very rough year and has very difficult decision on life changing operation he not want to make. Being part of that group and community was very important for him.

After he recieve large amount of harassment telling him to kill himself that spread from online and effect real life. He now resign from job. He seem to keep getting worse.

He feel his friend don't care. They keep making promise they break. He say two of the people in charge of that community say they could still be part of group that important but gave up when newer people in group not want him around. I talk to some of his friend and they say while want to help their hands tied by other member of group. Many of his friend now feel powerless and they hurting too. He say even after he prove that new people not wanting him around influenced by rumor spread by friend person in charge so scared of what would happen they dodge question.

He feel no one care. His friend all betray him. That he forget who he is. That he have nothing left to smile for. All while face with very complicated medical decision and it bridging to other community and real life.

People who say they care and want to help say they feel lost. His wording and behavior even more worrying than my girlfriend was.

,SuicideWatch,"A few months ago I posted here with thoughts of suicide. To sum up theses last few months, I am a 34 year old agoraphobic African American virgin, with 15 years in the United States Air Force dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts.  I came really close to attempting suicide after receiving my most recent assignment by going to a gun store with thought of shooting myself.  I quickly left the store and cried in a parking lot.  I called the suicide hotline and that quickly went South making me more depressed.  I thought about what was really making me unhappy and it was because the job I do just doesn't make me happy. 

After really thinking about my situation and talking to people on Reddit I got a link to the suicide chat-line. Which is perfect for a guy that has difficulty speaking and talking to people.  We came to the conclusion that I should just seperate use my GI bill to pursue what I love even if I don't get my military retirement at 38, I can work as a reservist and get my retirement much later.   What's the point of staying in the military for an early retirement if you don't live to see it?

Fast forward to now, I am currently in the process of seperating and I've never been happier. My superiors think I'm crazy but they don't know how close I came to killing myself. I tell them now that I'll give them all I have for the next few months but that's it....I'm ready to leave.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi,

I’ll try to make this short. 22, male, go to Big Ten school. I’m successful, high grades, lots of friends, applying to medical school with a solid chance at going to a good program. I’ve never struggled with depression, no one knows how I feel.

I wouldn’t even say I’m depressed now. I’m happy, have energy, am doing well in most areas of life. I’m gay, and no one knows. I have a very accepting family and friend group, and I know I will be embraced. For some reason, I just don’t want to face it even though I know it will be okay.

I would rather just go away. I don’t necessarily want to die, but I don’t want to live my life. I want to drive a couple thousand miles and start a new life. But with today’s technology, that isn’t realistic. The other option is to die.

The worst part is I can’t tell anyone how I feel. Not a friend, not a mental health professional, not a counselor... because they WILL (no doubt) commit me to a psych ward. And I do NOT want to go. I have had friends go who have told me how terribles those places are.

I feel that I  am always the least favorite person in the room, and the person that no one  likes; not because I am an asshole, but simply because I do not have a likable personality. 

For the last year or year and a half, I started fantasizing about dying. I started thinking about how death would be the end of all my problems. No more dealing with people I do not like, poverty, stress, criticism, etc. Sometimes I think of ways I could make that happen. Now, I also ""know"" or think that killing myself is something I would never do. I know it is something I just fantasize about but I know I simply do not have the courage to do something like that out of fear of pain, fear of the unknown afterlife, and fear to hurt my mother. I also do have a tiny bit of hope that things will work out and that there is a possibility of happiness for me. However, the occasional thought of how killing myself would be like does cross my mind often. Again, at the moment, I know this is something I could never do. I won't kill myself at the moment, and I do not see myself doing it. 

My question is mainly for those that are seriously planning to commit suicide or that attempted to do it in the past. Did you start out this way? Thinking ""nah, that is something I would never do but it's interesting to think about it"" and then that curiosity grew until you actually did it? Am I suicidal? Will I become suicidal if I do not seek help soon?

I've been dragging people down with me for years. I'm a manipulator. I know my current friends wont admit it, maybe they having even noticed. It took so long for me to realize what I was doing. I'm such a horrible person and all I do is play the victim and antagonize everyone around me to make myself look better. I've lost so many fiends and I desperately cling to the few friends I do have. I'm so toxic and controlling. 

Things have been so horrible recently, I've been in the longest and worst depressive episode of my life. I almost attempted suicide on New Year's Eve, that was the closest I've come to doing it.

My mom said it's my fault that he was sick because the vet said the illness is mostly caused by stress. I didn't do anything to hurt him, my cat is one of my best friends, I feel so guilty and crushed. Maybe it is my fault. I take all the blame now, maybe I shouldn't.

The reason my grades are bad is because I'm depressed and fucking suicidal not because the doctor thinks I have ahdh. I want to get help but my parents think I'm just being dramatic. 

My self harm has gotten worse. I keep cutting deeper and deeper, and I can't go longer than 2 days without cutting. Usually I have to cut multiple times a day.

Anyway, yes I know in 10 years I won't care but this matters to me now.

In our relationship I usually feel like i'm always starting conversations and doing most of the work. However this has gotten worse lately. She never talks to me about anything. She got into trouble that she told me only after I pressed her about drugs and stuff. Now her depression and anxiety has gotten so bad that she is going to a mental health program to deal with stuff.

I know it was her cause it used words only she used and she was the only person at that point to look at my post. For the record, I have talked her through 5 public mental breakdowns, and taken 4 years of her shit. I'm doing my best and when i'm upset she handles it so badly). A few months ago we were at a thing and I find her crying in the hallway. Being a good friend I do my best to comfort her-missing 20 minutes of work I could be doing. Anyway she has a whole rant and stuff and I say stuff that I really regret now. She was talking about how messed up her life was and how she needed to fix her problems with her sleep and her friends and stuff. The 2 things I should not have said are ""If they're really your friends they'll be there as long as you need"" and ""I will never leave you"". Now I want to leave but I feel trapped.

She promised me that she would ask if she could share what i tell her with my dad, she promised in front of the fucking therapist, its only been a week and she already broke that promise, i feel like i cant trust her at all anymore.

I just wanted to say goodbye cause I am done. I am fucking sick of life, I’m sick of going nowhere, constantly being a failure, being so alone and lonely all the time. I am just absolutely done now and don’t want to continue trying and failing anymore. Things are not only not getting better, they are faster and faster getting much worse for me. 

To my parents, if you are reading this, I’m sorry, it’s not anything you did specifically. I’m just not cut out for this world, for life, for anything quite frankly. I know you always told me to keep going and keep trying cause things will get better for me. Well I’m just sorry to say that things are only getting worse for me. And I’m done trying and subsequently failing over and over, I can’t put up with it anymore. 

And to Claire, if you are somehow reading this, I still love you and always will till my final moment. You were the best thing that ever happened to me, truly. I understand your reasons why you just had to be yourself when you told me that last year. You have to do what is best for you, and I would never stand in you way from doing what you felt was best for you, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t killed me inside every day being apart from you. The time we spent together is truly one of the only thing I have in my life I can look back on and smile, because you did make me so happy! I know we won’t be together again, and that knowledge kills me. But no matter how long it’s been since we last spoke or seen each other, I still think about you every day. I hope you are doing well, and I really hope you find true happiness in your life, because you really deserve it. I love you Claire, and always will. 

I’m sorry to everyone. I just cannot cope with life anymore. I don’t want to carry on. The pain, the hurt, the failure, everything, it’s all too much for me and I just don’t want to deal with it anymore.

I just wanted to say goodbye cause I am done. I am fucking sick of life, I’m sick of going nowhere, constantly being a failure, being so alone and lonely all the time. I am just absolutely done now and don’t want to continue trying and failing anymore. Things are not only not getting better, they are faster and faster getting much worse for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my parents, if you are reading this, I’m sorry, it’s not anything you did specifically. I’m just not cut out for this world, for life, for anything quite frankly. I know you always told me to keep going and keep trying cause things will get better for me. Well I’m just sorry to say that things are only getting worse for me. And I’m done trying and subsequently failing over and over, I can’t put up with it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to Claire, if you are somehow reading this, I still love you and always will till my final moment. You were the best thing that ever happened to me, truly. I understand your reasons why you just had to be yourself when you told me that last year. You have to do what is best for you, and I would never stand in you way from doing what you felt was best for you, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t killed me inside every day being apart from you. The time we spent together is truly one of the only thing I have in my life I can look back on and smile, because you did make me so happy! I know we won’t be together again, and that knowledge kills me. But no matter how long it’s been since we last spoke or seen each other, I still think about you every day. I hope you are doing well, and I really hope you find true happiness in your life, because you really deserve it. I love you Claire, and always will. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry to everyone. I just cannot cope with life anymore. I don’t want to carry on. The pain, the hurt, the failure, everything, it’s all too much for me and I just don’t want to deal with it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi. 

My girlfriend of 3 years has had some pretty tough days, and been down to point of were she doesn't want to talk, or in general do anything. I came home today, to her laying in her bed starring into the wall, and just crying. 

I tried to comfort her, but she ""doesn't"" want to talk about it. I gave her a little room yesterday to breathe, as she usually wants to process her thoughts first, before wanting to talk about them. 

Finally I made some grounds, and she told me that she is tired of fighting and just wants to end it all. I off course told her otherwise, but she believes, that she isn't worth anything and the world would be a better place without her, and she stands her grounds on that. 

I maybe became a little frustrated, and now she feels like I blame her (for wanting to kill herself) instead of trying to comfort her.  I think I got scared for a moment, and I really tried to understand her feelings, but how couldn't I? Was she expecting me to just lay down and accept that my girlfriend wants to fucking end her life? 

I found out by reading in her journal (yes, I know. Bad move, but I was worried, as she has tried to commit suicide before), that she maybe plans to kill herself this Thursday. I will be calling her treatment-center tomorrow, to tell them everything. 

She suffers from Schizotypy, and is in threatment. Actually, for the first time in her life, the treatment actually works, and she is making progress, but she feels that whatever she does, and no matter the treatment, she will never be able to work or function in this society (which is a lie. She just needs to start out slowly). 

I know, you guys can't do anything. I'm just lost. She is the love of my life, and I just can't get her out of this hole. I feel useless.

We had no sex during this time because she wanted to stay virgin till marriage until one day she told me to make it from the back .

Unfortunately i was not able to have erection because i was on antidepressants and I couldn't tell her because she wouldn't accept it as for depression she would thought about it as psychological problems ( i know her very well ) .

She never allowed me to try it back again we only would make it out through ( handjob , blowjob,ect...) . And it was normal with erection for like 6 times and failed with two due to emotional stress i had .

One day after making out she dumped me out of the blue without telling me the reason saying im a good guy and treats women very well but we are not a match .

Me and my ex works together at the same place with people who know me and my family very well and found out that my ex told someone that the reason she dumped me for was my bad erection and that person spread it all around .

I know myself very well and i have no problem with erection and i know the reason that happened to this but i have been in a very had depression for 4 months because of what happened and I can't stop people from talking about it and girls started to avoid me because of my erection rumor ( can't get a gf anymore )

I wouldn’t say I have friends, and the relationship with my wife was over long ago, but I have persons I care for, not yet friends but close. A few of them have experienced darkness and seemed understanding when dropping hints about my intentions.

However, I really don’t know if it is the right thing to do. I don’t want to make them indirectly responsible for inaction... or - god forbid - I don’t want them to call the police or something to get me locked up. 

But I really feel I need to share how I feel, beyond what a subreddit can offer me (with all respect!)
What’s your experience? Have you talked? Have you kept it for yourselves? Are you still here to tell the story?

Thanks.

The thing is that this sadness brings me to what i think are suicidal thoughts.

I tried last on dec 17 and it didnt work my parents never found out, i took the day after off and on the 19th  i went to school. 

Doing anything productive makes me feel like dying. Its like my head is constantly just telling me to put myself out of my misery.

I dont know how to get help. I'm not close with my parents. They dont understand how serious my issues are, when I was first diagnosed with anxiety i was sent to one therapy session, and then when the next one was scheduled, they never took me.

When I was around 8 or 9 my older sister tried to kill herself, and thats when they took her to therapy, not after she asked and asked. 

Last week my school faced the reality of an old classmate comitting suicide, there wasnt much talk about it, a few Snapchat stories, no assembly or offers to help any students who may have been greiving, or even any help to prevent other students from trying. I didnt know this kid, but it was an eye opener seeing the path i was setting up for myself. The scary thing is that it didnt push me farther, it made me want to hurry up the process and get it over with, like the lack of offers to change was just a clear path to escape. Like even if I got caught, i wouldnt be talked to about it.

,SuicideWatch,"So I (26 f) have PCOS, a hormonal disorder that makes a woman’s body produce more testosterone (amongst other things), and it causes facial hair growth, weight gain in the midsection, difficulty losing weight, acne, and other horrible symptoms. On top of that I’m almost 6 feet tall with thick brows and no booty. As the years have gone on, I’ve started to look more like a man although I’m always on top of my facial hair with laser hair removal appointments. 

I have to say that I’ve never thought that I looked like a man or even ugly until about 8 years ago when I heard about a rumor about me in high school that I was a man.  Needless to say, this hurt my feelings and really surprised me. Fast forward to 2 years ago, one day at work, a supervisor of mine referred to me as a strong man. To my face, followed up with a jk. I was shocked to say the least. I just froze up. I felt so small and just wanted to die. How could she dare say this TO MY FACE? I often times have flashbacks to this scene in my life and usually a start to a panic attack. 

Putting these two incidents together made me realize that this is probably the reason why I’m not considered to be conventionally attractive although finding a partner has never been difficult but just not as effortless like it is for most women. 

Fast forward again to last week, I vacationed to a resort in Mexico for my birthday and realized that I got a lot of stares. At first I thought it was because my outfit was super cute but even when I wore a basic T-shirt and shorts I’d get stares while just enjoying breakfast. It made me very uncomfortable and I honestly wanted to spend my whole vacation in the room bc I couldn’t just feel like everyone else. 

Then, when we were at the airport to go back home, one of the agents who inquired about our trip asked if my boyfriend and I were brothers. This seriously pissed me off. Why tf do people feel so bold to say things like that to my face. I honestly couldn’t care less if you snickered in private about me but again, to my face? My bf didn’t get defensive or upset, he just kind of laughed and said no man are you crazy? 😅Clearly not taking as much offense as I did. I brought this up to him when we were back home and told him how I felt and he just reassured me that I don’t look like a man but that was pretty much it. 

Since that happened I tried anything that would make me more feminine presenting. Wearing my hair in cute styles, wearing makeup more (even though it’s a pain in the ass to do everyday),smiling more, adding a little switch in my step when I walk. Anything to be seen as a woman but I still seem to be getting stares because people must think I’m trans m-&gt;f. 

I feel  shameful and don’t want to leave the house at this point even though I have a big trip to Asia planned this spring.  The stares are going to be a lot worse then since I’m already a giant for a woman in American standards. 

Because of said events I’ve started using more drugs to escape my daily depression/anxiety but it’s honestly just made it worse bc not only am I freak show to people but also a druggie. Great. 

I’ve never thought so seriously about suicide until now. 

Really needed to vent bc I’m way too embarrassed/scared  to let anyone in my life know about this. They would just feel sorry for me and worry about me to death.  And I’m just too poor for therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Putting these two incidents together made me realize that this is probably the reason why I’m not considered to be conventionally attractive although finding a partner has never been difficult but just not as effortless like it is for most women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward again to last week, I vacationed to a resort in Mexico for my birthday and realized that I got a lot of stares. At first I thought it was because my outfit was super cute but even when I wore a basic T-shirt and shorts I’d get stares while just enjoying breakfast. It made me very uncomfortable and I honestly wanted to spend my whole vacation in the room bc I couldn’t just feel like everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when we were at the airport to go back home, one of the agents who inquired about our trip asked if my boyfriend and I were brothers. This seriously pissed me off. Why tf do people feel so bold to say things like that to my face. I honestly couldn’t care less if you snickered in private about me but again, to my face? My bf didn’t get defensive or upset, he just kind of laughed and said no man are you crazy? 😅Clearly not taking as much offense as I did. I brought this up to him when we were back home and told him how I felt and he just reassured me that I don’t look like a man but that was pretty much it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that happened I tried anything that would make me more feminine presenting. Wearing my hair in cute styles, wearing makeup more (even though it’s a pain in the ass to do everyday),smiling more, adding a little switch in my step when I walk. Anything to be seen as a woman but I still seem to be getting stares because people must think I’m trans m-&amp;gt;f. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel  shameful and don’t want to leave the house at this point even though I have a big trip to Asia planned this spring.  The stares are going to be a lot worse then since I’m already a giant for a woman in American standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of said events I’ve started using more drugs to escape my daily depression/anxiety but it’s honestly just made it worse bc not only am I freak show to people but also a druggie. Great. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never thought so seriously about suicide until now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really needed to vent bc I’m way too embarrassed/scared  to let anyone in my life know about this. They would just feel sorry for me and worry about me to death.  And I’m just too poor for therapy. Sorry if this is too much of a pity party. Just really needed to get this out.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So... I'm planning to finish it all in about a month. Before I go, I wanted to leave my story somewhere. Hopefully, someone here might be able to help me out although I don't really expect so much.

I am 23M now, and was born in S.Korea from average family. My family including my parents and two brothers is mostly quiet but I know we do care for each other. From very young age, I was interested in science, and aimed to become a scientist. There are high schools specifically aimed to raise talented scientific students in my county and obviously, my goal was to get in there. It was extremely competitive thing and I studied hard. Fortunately, I was good at learning and always got in top 10 in my school. However, things happened and my family had to move to China for few years. In China, I went to Harrow Beijing, British international school, from Y9-Y11. At first, I had hard time fitting in since my English was not good back then, but once I got used to it, I enjoyed many aspects of it. Harrow is where I learned my country's education framework sucks and to stop by from studying from time to time and enjoy the life. I would say Harrow enlightened me whether for good or bad.

After 3 years of freshing experience at Harrow, life thing happened again and my family had to get back to SKorea. Obviously, I was too late to enter science specialized high school and went to just an ordinary high school in my country. Some people might already know, but the education in S.Korea is extremely harsh. Students were obligated to remain in school untill late at night. I'm talking about 9AM - 11PM. It was insane. I again had trouble adapting to this new system but this time it was more complicated. Studying all day at the school was obviously painful both mentally and physically but it was more than that. Harrow taught me critical thinking and things about life and that made me question if all this hard work is really worth it. I think at this point, I was really depressed continuously pondering about the life and death. Still, I could hold on to something. I was really into cosmology at that time, and just thinking about it made me excited. I still had a reason to stay alive. After 1.5yrs, I graduated and finally entered college.

My college was one of the best in my country and it was especially speciallized in science and technology. So I could say I was successful, or at least I achieved my first goal. The college life was refreshing again. I had lots of free time doing whatever I want, lived far from home in dormitary with roommates I came to become close to and joined clubs with shared interest people. I, still, was worried about the studies since it was bascially bunch of elitists from all around my country. To my surprise, I had absoultely no problem understanding lectures and got fairly good grades from all subjects. My first year in the college passed like that untroubled.

From the year after, however, I would say I was not living a healthy life. I had much less chances to meet my friends as we got separate majors (in my college, first graders all share most of the lectures and we choose our major from the next year). They also all had their roommates reserved for their best friends, so I had to live with random roommates. For some reasons, I had trouble making friends from new people I met in new lectures. The same went for my new roommates. We barely talked to each other and lived their own lives. I guess this is the point when I started to feel truly alone and hang on to my old friends. Depression did not really help with my studies also. I felt less motivated and for the first time in my life started to have some difficulties understanding things in lecture. Still, it wasn't worst. I got fair grades somehow. Not so good, but not so bad. Just average results. However, I still had hopes of studying cosmology and that made me keep going somehow.

As some of you might have guessed, it didn't get better the next year. I still couldn't make new friends and my friends decided to focus on studying, and we barely hung out together. My roommate spent most of the time outside, even spending night somewhere else. I got more depressed each day and spent most of my time playing games in my room alone. My motivation almost ran out and I started to miss out lectures. Still at this point, I had some hope left. I continued on. But it was the sixth semester. It was the climax. I had absolutely no contact with my friends for three whole months. Instead I tried to motivate myself in studying and got fairly good grades at mid exam. I would say, I was lonely and depressed but hopeful. Then, for unknown reason it exploded. I lost my emotions. To be more precise, I was crying in the bed everyday before, but at some point, I felt no more loneliness, depression and hope. I suddenly lost all my urges to do anythings. I didn't want to study, didn't want to go out and didn't even want to play. Everything was void. I missed most of the classes, never finished homwork and finally failed my finals. And I didn't care. I would just stay in my room stare at empty space for an hour or so. Every time I do anything, it was so much stress. I just wanted to vanish.

Since then, I'm having break from school for over 2 years now. I feel a bit calm at home fortunately, but I still have no motivation to live. I just let time pass by. For these 2 years, I always wanted to disappear from this world, and half a year ago, I finally began to consider suicide seriously. Now, I AM suicidal. I plan to die at some point in march this year despite the fear of pain and consequences of death. And before you ask, I've been to therapists and Department of Mental Health Medicine for treatments. You know what. The pills I'm still taking do not seem to have any affect. Therapists admitted that they can't seem to help me and introduced new therapists. Current therapist also have difficulties determining my state. I also tried some on my own. I tried to do some exercise, but the physical tiredness just makes me so stressful. Same goes for hobbies. I tried to draw or something but they gave so much stress that my head starts to hurt. For past few months, I worked on my last resort. I tried to get what I really wanted to before if that might help, but financial issues made them to go all in vain. Now, I can't think of anything I can try. Clock's ticking towards my Dday and now I'm preaparing to let everything go.

So... that's my whole story. Unlike may other in this thread, my life was not so troubled. I had no childhood abuse, trauma of something or lost something/someone important. It was just loneliness but I endured it for years, I don't think that was the real reason behind it. I can't even... know what caused this, what is wrong and how I would want to be. I just feel like... I don't fit into this world really that it was eventually to happen at some point. I don't know now. I am just too tired, I want to finish it all. And thinking that I'm gonna die soon makes me both worried and relieved. Sorry and thanks for reading my long post. It is somewhat my last attempt before I let everything go, so I'm open for talk although I doubt it would make any differences. Well, I failed but I hope anyone here who needs help gets better.

Never thought this was the route I'd be taking, all my life I've been hiding behind a fake persona. I'm 22 and on benefits wtf.

I'm due to see a psychologist or psychiatrist i dont know anything i get confused, agitated, frustrated and angry easy. I hate people the way my head perceives everything I guess. On my down days all I do is plan my own death and to get through those times I promise myself that I will do it.

To give some background, I had always lived in a turbulent environment between my parents, and later between my stepbrother. I had always been stressed when my family argued, and I eventually got sad every time they fought. Eventually, my mom and dad divorced, and my soul was crushed. My mom was constantly sad, and my dad cried on Christmas Day. I was so fucking damaged by seeing my parents this sad. Eventually my mom and dad remarried to my stepparents. My stepdad and stepbrother would soon lead to many of my issues. For the longest time, my stepbrother fought with me, be it physical or mentally. It had gotten so bad, that I cried when I had to see him. Eventually, my stepbrother started arguing with my my stepdad and mom, which made me feel upset, because it reminded me of my parents arguing. My stepdad hurt me much deeper on the emotional level. He was a big tough guy, and I was nothing but a weak, worthless, nerdy piece of shit. He would often make me and my stepbrother move logs for hours, and judged me every time I took a break. My lack of strength, both physically, and emotionally led to him calling me a baby, pussy, whine-ass, and generally just barading me about my weaknesses for 4 straight years. The worst thing my stepdad told me, however, was on my mom's birthday. I'm bad with remembering dates, so she intentionally didn't tell me that it was her birthday. She ended up upsetting herself, and my stepdad barged in and told me I was being a terrible son. This cut deeper than most of you would think it would, but trust me, that one comment hurt like shit. However, the reason I cut myself extends beyond what I just talked about. I didn't tell my stepmom about my issues, because she hates when I'm emotional. I didn't tell my dad because he is easily angered, and I was worried he'd think I was overreacting. And I didn't tell my 2 friends, because they didn't believe I was depressed. This balled up inside until I broke down in front of my mom and my dad, both on separate days. My dad had surprisingly listened, and my mom said she wouldn't tell my stepdad. I eventually got a therapist, and some meds, but that didn't stop the inevitable. I had no hobbies besides video games, because I had nobody to share my hobbies with. One of my friends is a frequent traveller, and the other has a loaded schedule. So one day, out of boredom, me and my stepbrother; who I now had good relations with, were messing around in my room. I accidentally knocked over a potted plant, broke the huge vase, and spilled dirt on the carpet. I was too overwhelmed with guilt at the time to speak, so my stepbrother tried to be my representative. Unfortunately, he brushed it off as something minor, while I was self-shaming myself for ""ruining everything I touch"". My mom forgave us, but my stepdad did not. My stepdad decided he would take away the one thing I had; my video games. I couldn't tell if I was laughing or crying hysterically, but I started to slam myself against the wall and hurt myself. I cut out self-depricating phrases on my arm, and cut myself all over with a kitchen knife. Eventually, my mom found out when she saw the cuts on me, and the knife on the counter. I know somebody out there will think I was ""overreacting"", but my brain didn't recognize that term at the time. And how would you, personally, feel if you lost the only thing that kept you occupied? How would you feel after you lost the closest thing you had to a life? And how would you feel after years of emotional pain?

I’ve always been depressed. I’m 26 now and I’ve been dating the same girl for 4 years.

Sometimes I love her, i want to marry her, life together, etc.

Other times I imagine myself being happier with someone else. Maybe someone more attractive or with more things in common (note: my gf already quite attractive and we share interests, not necessarily perfectly my type but nobody is).

But I’ve had this with other things. I’m incapable of Happiness unless I am EXTREMELY distracted, or drunk. or both.

when im not distracted, i think about everything. maybe ill never be happy. maybe ill never be skilled enough in my interests and hobbies to satisfy me.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m posting this on my main account because I’ve lost all will to hide how truly unhappy I am from everyone I know. It’s exhausting to wake up every new day and put on a false facade, to act like I’m perfectly fine and that everything is fine.


I’m not *fine*. I’m not *okay*. I’m fucking miserable. I am so miserable, I want to claw my eyes out with my bare hands and scream until my throat goes hoarse and gives out. I want to punch a wall until my knuckles are obliterated, perhaps then I would actually feel something. 


I don’t feel anything but anger, anxiety, sadness, and exhaustion. Unending anger at the life I’ve been given, what I’ve had to endure, and the way I’ve been treated by people and their mindless games. The anxiety is *relentless*, I shake inside more than I fucking breathe, a cold shivering that never ends. Sadness for the waste of a life I am, my dreams I’ll never achieve, and the fact that one day everyone I love and cherish will probably have to wake up to the news that I killed myself. 


But I just can’t take this anymore. It’s like being at sub zero at the bottom of the ocean; light can’t penetrate the darkness below. Every day is the same, yesterday was the same as today and tomorrow will be the same as today, there’s no end to this fucking cruel, vicious cycle. It’s just beating into my soul, the glass cracks just a bit more every day. 


I’m undesirable. I’ve had several hook ups just for validation, just to feel desired in the moment. I don’t want sex or a relationship, I just want to feel like someone actually desires me for *me*. Someone who would be there for me, someone who actually cares about me and would hold me in their arms. Someone to save me. But if I can’t love myself, who else can love me?


I’m too damaged to ever crawl out of this dark. A broken husk of my former self, but I don’t even know who I was, everything has been twisted and distorted past distinguishing anything. There’s nothing left but empty aspirations and dreams, compassion and kindness for anyone but me; I don’t deserve that much. All I deserve is a bullet to the brain, something to put me out of my misery. 


I still ponder why my friends stick around and why my family puts up with me; Who the fuck am I? What have I accomplished? What do I bring to the table? I’m nothing, I’ve come from nothing and I’ll be nothing for the rest of my fucked up life. Why does anyone give a fuck about me, I’m a fucking depressed piece of shit loser whose no one. 


It says something when I have to come *here* to vent, to a bunch of strangers on the internet. Despite how quiet and shy I am, I do have a voice; I have words I want to let out, but no one wants to listen. No one understands just how fucking miserable I am, no matter how much I try to put it into perspective. “You need to get out more, Life has just begun, Things get better, You just need to hold on, You just need to push yourself, You’re too young to be depressed, You need to do this and that, etc.”

,SuicideWatch,"Pretty much my whole life up until recently I had not really considered suicide. I valued life a lot more, and the thought of it seemed really scary. I didn't really consider it a viable thing for me to do or an option... until recently. I'm not sure what really triggered it, my life is better than it used to be. I used to live with family I hated and now I don't. You would expect that to make me happier, right? no. 

**WHY I WANT TO LIVE** There has never been much that I've really enjoyed in life. I've never really had any major aspirations or interests. Video games is the thing that I and most people who know me would say is my greatest interest. I've enjoyed gaming my whole life, and I still do, but I have definitely started to lose interest in gaming. I'm not sure why this is.. maybe something to do with getting older? I'm not sure. It would be such a shame for me to go and not be able to play games anymore. I wouldn't be able to see news about gaming, wouldn't know any of the new consoles or games that are coming out, that would be such a shame.

In all honesty, I would say that my biggest reason for wanting to live right now is that i want to explore sex. I have such a desire to explore sex. I'm 19 years old, and still a virgin. I've never even kissed a girl. Sex is something that I have desired for so long, and being a virgin at 19 while as other people who are younger than me have experienced it makes me so upset and jealous. It would be so upsetting to have to die a virgin while so many other people my are would be alive, having sex regularly. I'm so desperate to lose my virginity and have sex, among exploring so many other things related to sex and exploring my sexuality. Doing all this is a very exciting thing, and I want to live so that i can experience all these things.

**WHY I WANT TO DIE** Living is so.. intense. There is so much that is expected of you. There is so much that you are expected to do in life. I'm only 19, and right now I don't have many responsibilities when you compare with other, although I feel it's too hard to live on. If I can't handle life, and there are so many others who do so much more than I do, work so much harder than I do, and they can handle it... this makes me feel as though i'm not really meant for life. I'm not cut out for life. I'm not strong enough to handle life.  Life is not meant for me.

With life being so stressful and hard for me right now, and with it only going to get harder as I live on, why continue living? I'm not enjoying life, and ending it would hopefully put me at peace. The anxiety that I experience every day and the sadness that I hide do not make living worth it at all. Every single problem I have, Every single worry that I face, Suicide would end it all. This is something that i never really thought about until recently.

Overall, I feel like the reasons I have for not wanting to live outweigh the reasons for wanting to live. As for possible methods, I've done some research and it's really hard to choose. I wish i had a pill that would just kill me peacefully. I would like to jump from a great height, but I am not sure where to do that.. and if I were to mess that up and live whilst having to deal with the possible injuries... I really can't imagine anything worse. I would be more suicidal as my life would be significantly worse from having to deal with the injuries, and also having to deal with everyone I know knowing what i did. Jumping in front of a train would definitely be the most convenient method, but I don't think I would be doing that. When I am around trains I get the urge, but I have looked up the statistics and the fatality rate is way too low. I'm at a great loss on what to do.

I hide all these feelings from everybody I know, so if I were to go through with this I feel as though it would be a great shock to so many people. It would be nice to have some other people's ideas and insights instead of me just saying all this stuff in my own head all the time. I just feel really lost on what I want to do, and I am so conflicted right now.",t2_5jm2hhnw,False,,0,False,Been experiencing suicidal thoughts for the first time recently.

I valued life a lot more, and the thought of it seemed really scary. I didn&amp;#39;t really consider it a viable thing for me to do or an option... until recently. I&amp;#39;m not sure what really triggered it, my life is better than it used to be. I used to live with family I hated and now I don&amp;#39;t. You would expect that to make me happier, right? no. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY I WANT TO LIVE&lt;/strong&gt; There has never been much that I&amp;#39;ve really enjoyed in life. I&amp;#39;ve never really had any major aspirations or interests. Video games is the thing that I and most people who know me would say is my greatest interest. I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed gaming my whole life, and I still do, but I have definitely started to lose interest in gaming. I&amp;#39;m not sure why this is.. maybe something to do with getting older? I&amp;#39;m not sure. It would be such a shame for me to go and not be able to play games anymore. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to see news about gaming, wouldn&amp;#39;t know any of the new consoles or games that are coming out, that would be such a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I would say that my biggest reason for wanting to live right now is that i want to explore sex. I have such a desire to explore sex. I&amp;#39;m 19 years old, and still a virgin. I&amp;#39;ve never even kissed a girl. Sex is something that I have desired for so long, and being a virgin at 19 while as other people who are younger than me have experienced it makes me so upset and jealous.

They currently have me on regular Clonazepam to chill me out and to help my PTSD. but I’m still having bad anxiety about going into there, can anyone who has been in a private/nhs adult mental health unit give me an idea of how it’s gonna be please, is it gonna be as bad as I think or hopefully you guys can put my mind to rest 🙏 thanks everyone",t2_25pac28z,False,,0,False,Mental heath unit anxiety,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_ev2t0v,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580228511.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TRIGGER WARNING  (OD, Suicide attempt)&lt;/h2&gt;

I’m just dumping this here because i don’t know where else to put these thoughts.

People think that because i am on track to be “successful” and because i work out enough to look good that i must be happy. They think because i appear to be confident and social, that i must enjoy life. nobody knows that i have had severe depression on and off for the last two years, and that sometimes my will to live just completely goes out the window and it makes everything in life feel impossible. I do not believe in any god or afterlife and i am unfortunately deeply rooted in the belief that life on earth was a fluke and that nothing has any purpose, and that when we die we return to the earth as atoms and our consciousness is forgotten forever. I try and bury these feelings and live a happy life but they always come back when i least expect it and before i know it there’s tears rolling down my face and that familiar emptiness in my chest starts swallowing me whole, and i find myself wishing that i could just stop being conscious forever. seems like an effective shortcut to the end we all inevitably meet anyways. i feel alone in my sentiment and that nobody would understand where i’m coming from, so i never talk about it. i don’t fear death. i believe that ceasing to exist would be a neutral experience, and therefore could not be any worse than life. i am always so tired and the happiness that i project to others is often feigned in desperation, in an attempt to fake it till i make it. i guess i figured i could be happy if i acted happy and did stuff that happy, social people did, but nothing is ever rewarding to me. after so many months of this, and so many times thinking i had escaped it only for it to return and strip all the blooming happiness in my life away, i simply feel ready for the end. i have contemplated suicide hundreds of times in the last two years, and i’m back in a phase where i consider it at least once a day. i’m not posting this for advice. i know i should get therapy if i want to get better, but i don’t really want to be happy- i would sort of rather just cease to exist. i never asked to be born and existence generally seems like a cruel and unforgiving state for the endlessly curious human mind. by realizing that death is a neutral, painless transition into the void where i can be forgotten, i feel like i have overcome the desire to survive and reproduce which all living beings are unfortunately endowed with. nobody else feels this way because we have been programmed over billions of years to optimize our own survival. all i can say is fuck my programming, i’m unplugging from the matrix.",t2_5jnum9c7,False,,0,False,hopeless,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_ev2q7t,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580227961.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello&lt;/p&gt;

I try and bury these feelings and live a happy life but they always come back when i least expect it and before i know it there’s tears rolling down my face and that familiar emptiness in my chest starts swallowing me whole, and i find myself wishing that i could just stop being conscious forever. seems like an effective shortcut to the end we all inevitably meet anyways. i feel alone in my sentiment and that nobody would understand where i’m coming from, so i never talk about it. i don’t fear death. i believe that ceasing to exist would be a neutral experience, and therefore could not be any worse than life. i am always so tired and the happiness that i project to others is often feigned in desperation, in an attempt to fake it till i make it. i guess i figured i could be happy if i acted happy and did stuff that happy, social people did, but nothing is ever rewarding to me. after so many months of this, and so many times thinking i had escaped it only for it to return and strip all the blooming happiness in my life away, i simply feel ready for the end. i have contemplated suicide hundreds of times in the last two years, and i’m back in a phase where i consider it at least once a day. i’m not posting this for advice. i know i should get therapy if i want to get better, but i don’t really want to be happy- i would sort of rather just cease to exist. i never asked to be born and existence generally seems like a cruel and unforgiving state for the endlessly curious human mind. by realizing that death is a neutral, painless transition into the void where i can be forgotten, i feel like i have overcome the desire to survive and reproduce which all living beings are unfortunately endowed with. nobody else feels this way because we have been programmed over billions of years to optimize our own survival. all i can say is fuck my programming, i’m unplugging from the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

So I've been hit with a ruler once I think and I was hit until it broke. I only recall this once but is this okay? I've heard many of my friends say that they've been hit too (as it's sort of asain culture). I remeber I was in trouble because I lied to my mother due to being afraid of being caught and hit again.

Is this okay?

I feel like I did something to deserve it in a way
Anyways when she was yelling at me I only heard a ringing noise and my vision started to turn black. I wasn't really able to see her but I heard her clearly. I remember that I didn't say anything cause I was too scared admit it to her and getting into more trouble.
Right now I haven't been spanked (or hit) but I just remember it vividly and I don't have the guys to tell my mother about it. I remember my mother saying how ""liars go to hell"", ""why'd you lie about your grades? I would have found out anyways"", ""why do I take you to tutor when you'll just get B's?"", ""look at me"" and ""why are you crying?""

Anyways I feel guilty... I recently heard she had rheumatism (I think) right after I was born. I'm the only child right now and I just feel like I have to get good grades so I can do something... I guess

This friend I mentioned in particular always gave me a listening ear. It was to the point where every conversation was my personal therapy session even though she couldn't handle my shit, but I didn't realize that because she never told me to ""shut the fuck up, I cant handle you right now"" or whatever. 
Now for the shit topping on the shit cake. I have ocd and when she didn't text me for a couple weeks ( because she was done with my shit ) I went absolutely nuts, and came up with the worst conclusions. ( ie, ""she hates me,"" ""what if shes dead?"" Etc ) I even went as far as to contacting her fucking parents like a crazy ex. 
Somehow, she agreed to talk to me so I can explain. Whatever trust and kindness she has left for me is going into this explanation and I cant fuck it up.

The people around me would be better off if i wasn&amp;#39;t here. 
This friend I mentioned in particular always gave me a listening ear. It was to the point where every conversation was my personal therapy session even though she couldn&amp;#39;t handle my shit, but I didn&amp;#39;t realize that because she never told me to &amp;quot;shut the fuck up, I cant handle you right now&amp;quot; or whatever. 
Now for the shit topping on the shit cake. I have ocd and when she didn&amp;#39;t text me for a couple weeks ( because she was done with my shit ) I went absolutely nuts, and came up with the worst conclusions. ( ie, &amp;quot;she hates me,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;what if shes dead?&amp;quot; Etc ) I even went as far as to contacting her fucking parents like a crazy ex. 
Somehow, she agreed to talk to me so I can explain. Whatever trust and kindness she has left for me is going into this explanation and I cant fuck it up.

,SuicideWatch,"Back in October I had the happiest day I'd had in years. My soon-to-be-ex-wife and I spent a weekend in a hotel. We haven't lived together in about a year, so it was a big deal. We seemed (at least to me) to be having a good time and getting along. We had sex (first time for me in over a year prior) and watched tv and talked and cuddled and played a trivia game. Basically it felt like how it was years and years ago. I was happy. The next day, however, things were back to the way they had been.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone! I won't tell my name but you can call me GG. I'm a 25 years old female that suffers multiple mental disorders such as anxiety (since I was 6 years old), depression (since I was 18) and dissociative personality disorder (since I was 20). Also, I have suicidal tendencies. 

Everything started when I was 6 years old and I suffered a very traumatizing loss of a loved one, my favorite person in the world, my grandfather. Since that moment I started to suffer multiple anxiety (panic) attacks every single day at any moment. Most of the times happened at school. I remembered that all the other kids started to be scared of me or thought that I was insane. From that moment I slowly started to lose all my friends and my capacity to socialize like a normal person. I became a lonely and insecure person. I was so nervous doing almost anything because I wanted it to be perfect, I wanted to please my parents and make them be proud of me, but it was never enough. There were so demanding that I wasn't even able to draw anything because they thought that I was copying or that the drawing wasn't symmetrical or realistic. FOR FUCK SAKE I WAS A KID!!! My parents never accepted that I had a mental disorder due to the trauma, not even when the psychologist of the school told them. Alongside the mental disorder, I develope some ""actions"" like biting my nails, intense scratching, excessive blinking, unusual stuff like that. Every time I did these actions, instead of comforting me, they used to push me and tell me I was a freak or insane. Believed it or not at some point I got used to it. 

Time went by until I was 16 still lonely and introvert (parents same as always) but somehow I managed to click with someone, time passed and he became my first boyfriend. I was finally happy! I had someone that loved me for who I really was, no mask no lies just love...until one day he attempted suicide but failed. I was devastated! I tried everything to make him happy and silences his demons but didn't work. One month after the suicide attempt he left me and moved to another country and started a new relationship. He didn't even say goodbye, he just cut communication. 

4 years passed, I was 20 years old when I started to hear voices and having the most strange situations in my life, doing things I don't remember doing, forgetting almost everything and having fiscal weird sensations I was losing my mind!. At that time I decided to deal with the situation without involving my parents. I went with 3 psychologists and nothing worked. Then I went with a psychiatrist he told me that aside from my anxiety and depression I also suffer from a mental disorder called dissociative personality disorder also known as multiple personality disorder. I have just one alter personality who is very aggressive, self-destructive, selfish and dark REALLY DARK!!. But somehow we get along pretty well (believe it or not, I can't even believe it myself). I know it's hard but I try to be as normal as I can.

Despite all of this I've managed to survive but in the last 3 years my depression, my demanding parents, college, work, the lack of social life, my low self-esteem and insecurity in everything I do, the fear of change, etc. are getting the best of me. I developed suicide tendencies and I think about my death every day, EVERY DAY! slowly planning how it is gonna be, every single detail, the method I'll use, how I want my body to be found, my last meal, etc. 

I'm tired I really am!  I feel like I lived an entire life. Every day my demons become stronger and I can't silence them.

Of course, I'm doing something to get out of this situation! I have medication (a lot of pills) but nothing seems to work, I try to do my favorite things, exercise, meditate, going to the doc, talking to the suicide line, make new friends, go to groups sessions, have a pet, etc, etc, etc. But nothing is working! Many people say that If i commit suicide I will ruin the lives of my family, but at this point, I don't care I just want to stop the pain, the loneliness and stop living in fear.

I already attempted suicide ones so this will be my second one.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, 

I am not sure what to say, I just don't have anyone to talk to and I am just posting this because I really want something may change. I guess I can call myself an introvert, I am extremely passively aggressive and try to take it out on other people. I hate doing things like tests because I seem to always fail over and over again, despite having studied for numerous hours. I am losing track of my life. I was not suicidal at all. I understand this because I have taken Psychology and I look at myself as someone who is mentally depressed and only seek paradise through ""luck"" and games.

I have known a person at my high-school who has committed suicide and I thought it was a terrible thing to do, until much recently.

I have always dealt with stress through playing games and watching anime. I have two siblings, a mom and dad and a somewhat poorly stabilized family. I first started feeling suicidal when I finally finished the 12th grade in 2016. I began being too addicted to games, however I spend less time on them now then I use to. I am the eldest child in my family and I know being a role-model has to be my responsibility. I have been a terrible older brother, I rarely do anything and I cannot seem to change my life around despite how many times I try. Despite this I never talked about being suicidal, to anyone. I never been bullied nor have I done any crimes. I have probably lied my entire life in college however. I lied to my parents and to myself, I even tried abandoning the only games I play. 

I am now in community college because I lost my way in High-school. I have played too much games and I found myself stuck in the so called ""two year college"". I thought college was a land of opportunity as I took the IGETC program and finished it with some withdraws and retakes. It took me around 2 and a half year with a 2.8 GPA. I had met with three different counselors over my four years at my community college. I talked to my first counselor after finishing my IGETC, she mentioned that I need to have a career in check. However, I didn't had a career in mind in order to transfer, therefore I took some more classes that could help boost my GPA and help me find the career that I really enjoyed. I then met with a different counselor a couple months after to help me find a major that I really wanted to be in. I ended up going for some business concentrated career and I found Elementary Statistics to be very hard, however I manage to pass. I was also struggling in my driver test, which I ended up failing three times total. I had my last contact with a different counselor which recommended me a different major, which was in Technology but I had to take many courses to get into the college that is right for me. I have taken around 5 of the 12 courses and some had heavy prerequisites. I wasn't a big fan of math, but I understand how to do it. I missed out on some placements and forgot to take my test for higher placement. I went to college to learn and get a good education to change my life around. I found the opportunity cost to be relatively small if I went for some stupid major. I had to take courses on things that I didn't understand at all. I am doing my best to understand them. I feel like I am lost in many ways possible. I don't remember my childhood anymore because of stress. I hate telling the truth to my parents because they supported me for so long and I was trying my best in my situation. 

My situation right now isn't that good, I am at my last straw out of a thousand. I took some design courses to boost my GPA to 2.99, but it made my situation worst because I felt like I am stuck in school. A Bachelors only need 4 years of education. I am starting my fourth year from 2016 to 2020. I have too much time invested into college and I am doing my best to increase my assignment workload. Just recently I took two courses for the one month winter semester and I forgot to register for my Spring, I did try to add some courses that my counselor has planned out, but I am stuck in a loop where I don't have my prerequisite for some of my major and prerequisite classes done. I don't want to stay in this loop hole any longer. I don't even have any work experience besides community service which I did in High-school. I have a small plan on what to do in order to get my two major courses, however it is going to be my last straw. I need to join these next classes within a couple of hours, or this post may be the last thing I would write online.",t2_5jmkw1tk,False,,0,False,"Stuck in Life, Last Straw, Not sure what to do.",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_ev16pm,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580218107.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;/p&gt;

I'm just a loser, plain and simple. No job, unmarried (that's what I have wanted SO bad), no kids (another thing I want SO bad). Been in an almost 10 year relationship, but since I'm so disgusting and worthless, we still aren't married. If I were beautiful, had a nice body, I don't even know.... I would be married. But instead, I suffer from body dysmorphia and can't tell if it's because I'm ugly, or for some other reason.  Whatever the reason, I'm pass the point of caring anymore.

Every time things seem to be going well, something happens. We always have setbacks. Every.Damn.Time. Starting as early as 2011 when I miscarried. Then again, in 2013 I misscarried twins.  In 2016 we were moving into a nice place when suddenly, a death in the immediate family. All of our money we had saved went to burrying her and funeral costs. It sent both of us into a deep depression.  We finally dug ourselves out of the hole and things got much better., then we had to move AGAIN due to the owners of the house wanting to move back.  We were then living in a motel with my dog and cat for four months. It sucked, big time. But we made it work. We finally got out of the hotel and found a beautiful place by the lake.  We went ring shopping, talked about venues, I was happy. Then, our place caught fire. I was devistated. We ended up being not at fault, the fault was due to the landlord's poor maintenance and upkeep. But, now the landlord is trying to sue us.

I now live in a living room with zero privacy. My boyfriend and I are staying with his grandma who is starting to develop dementia and is in denial. It's really hard to live with. There is constant loud noises here since she is going deaf, and noise is a HUGE trigger for me. I now have to wear noise cancelling headphones or I end up having an episode.  I'm just....done.

Life won't get better. It won't. Every time it does, this happens. So I've lost the ability to even think positively anymore. I just want out. No one will miss me, and my boyfriend can find a real woman who he can marry and have a family with.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi,

I was thinking about one thing and could use some help understand the situation.

I will try to keep my story as short as possible: I am an adoptee and have been struggling with depression for over 10 years now. A few years ago (3 years) I hit rock bottom and planned taking my own life. I started to push away all my friends. I never did anything social and barely spoke to them. I was lying in bed or staying in my room for most of the time. My parents (adoptive-parents) notice that something was wrong, and we had a long fight because they knew something was wrong, and I didn't tell them. Suddenly i burst out ""I don't want to live anymore"" and everything went quiet, and my mother was speechless.

The day ended up with my mother crying and didn't understand why, my father got a little upset because I made my mother cry. (Please note that both of them are great parents and I love them very deeply). The next day they approach me very carefully and asked me if I could go and see a therapist so I could take to someone about it - Because I refused to tell them about my feeling.

I saw a therapist for a few times, but I feel like the therapist didn't care and I stop going. I felt better for 1-2years thanks to my friends, who helped me see a new side of things. BUT me and my parents have never ever talked about it again, and it have been around 3 years now. I know my mother is still worry about it, but I kind of feel like it just didn't happen. Is that normal? It feel like nothing really happen yet I feel that they worry everytime I am home for holidays or whatever. Its just so weird, Im telling them something that big and just shove it under the carpet?

Or am I reading this wrong?

to be free from mental illness and pain and suffering and the unbearable anguish of seeing someone or something you love die. 

once you’re gone nothing matters and you are free.

I'm always so, aware.. of everything.. Everything I do, everything people do, everything people mean and say. I know what my mind thinks, I know my issues. I'm friends with my demons. But every time I actually process something, every time I actually manage to get better, the chronic darkness always comes back, and the better I am, the worse it hits.

I called 911 for help and because of that he is up on charges of assault, assault with a weapon and uttering threats to cause bodily harm. My son, myself and my husband all live with my mother because we are basically poor as dirt. 

When my son was released from the overnight lockup he called my mom to let her know about all the trouble that I got him in.

My son goes to court on Feb. 5th and if the charges aren't dropped my mother is kicking me and my husband out to let my son come back home. 

I've been treated like a piece of shit my whole life. I lived through my father being an alcoholic during my early years. Then went through my parents divorcing. I was constantly ridiculed at school for being over weight. My cousin sexually abused me when I was 9 until 14. My parents remarried when I was 18 and I was kicked out because my mother suspected him of cheating and asked my boyfriend to see if his car was at his ex wife's house one day and yes, my dad was cheating. Of course I was just a liar and my mother betrayed me saying she never asked my bf to do anything. I got pregnant and married that boyfriend and he abused me verbally, psychologically, physically and financially. I had no choice but to divorce him and take my son and move back in with my parents. Then my father decided it was his turn to abuse me. Nothing I did was good enough for him. I would wake up hearing him through the baby monitor yelling about what a piece of shit I was and how I was treated better than him by my mom (haha yeah right).

Then she caught him cheating, kicked him out, got clean and turned all her anger on me. That covers my life up until the age of 25.

I've been suffering for awhile now trying my hardest to ignore the fact that I need a therapist (psychologist) to help me. I was abused as a child in more ways than one and my parents failed me. I don't want to go into it too much, right now. 

This quote: “Living is like tearing through a museum. Not until later do you really start absorbing what you saw, thinking about it, looking it up in a book, and remembering - because you can't take it in all at once.” is basically what the last 3 years of my life have become. I never thought about what happened to me because I was trying to survive my reality but now all I can do is feel the pain that those memories left me. I have a loving husband, I am not an alcoholic or drug addict (unlike my mother), and even got a dog! I survived my past only to be tormented by it. I saw a therapist awhile ago and was told I am suffering from PTSD, depression, anxiety - the works- but I thought I worked past the pain and was on the path to freedom. 

I was wrong.

I haven't been able to hold a job because panic attacks are common, I hate myself, and I am a frequent flier of suicidal idealization. I cry constantly, can barely look at myself in the mirror and feel like I completely lost the girl who was fun, fierce and able to hold a conversation with a stranger without worrying about their perception of me. I haven't had my phone on me for 3 months because I am scared of my parents contacting me even though I told my mom I forgive her, I don't think I can yet since all the things she said and did haunt me. My dad, I don't talk to but I can't block his number because I feel guilty.  I think I thought that I could solve this on my own because I was strong but there must be something really wrong with me that is out of my control. 

I'm broken at the moment and I have finally gotten to the point where I know I cannot do this on my own. I don't know why I am sharing this, but it's bringing me peace. Admitting that I need help is something that has been long over due, not only for myself but for my loved ones. I'm tired. I think I'm looking for support since I've become afraid of contact with people other than my husband (like panic attack worthy scared-ness) or words of encouragement. I don't have a job or health insurance so don't really know what to do but there must be a way?

No one will be given a warning.

No one will be reached out to

In any other way than to just...

...be given a nudge, to see if...

They're really there...

Or not...

And that's all...

If even that...

Because it won't be thought upon for long.

It won't be drawn out.

It will be simple.

It will be as simple as going to the fridge,

Walking outside,

Starting up a car,

Taking a sip of water,

Pressing a foot on the gas pedal,

Pulling back on a trigger...

&amp;#x200B;

Without thought.

It will be a split-second decision.

&amp;#x200B;

If I myself have any warning,  
it's not like I'll have known for long.

It's not like I'll have enough time  
to inform someone even if I wanted to.

And I don't... I don't want to...

My death is mine; it's not yours.

It's personal.

If I had it my way, there would be no body.

I'd simply disappear and be done with you all.

Fairly alienating sounding, I know.

It's not personal.

And if you've been depressed,  
then you know the feeling.

And you know...  
It's not personal...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm old enough, and have been depressed for long enough...

That I know this is a whim decision.

A permanent fix to a temporary problem.

Hence...why I am writing this and not doing anything stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

But... Someday...?

Someday, I might actually prefer a stupid decision  
to the alternative...

&amp;#x200B;

I live for myself, largely, but us humans, we are social creatures,  
and (alienating again, I know) I just find that I become  
disappointed...all too often...

&amp;#x200B;

I was happy when I was a single man.

I lived in solitude, and it actually benefited me.

But it was still lacking...

&amp;#x200B;

There's no point going back to that,  
and the direction of life should never  
be backwards; it should be forwards,  
to a new life, a new day, a new chance  
at changing everything around,  
and maybe, maybe, maybe,  
one day I'll wake up, live,  
and end my day  
just a little bit differently,  
where I find myself sitting  
in the warm lamplight  
of my home,  
wherever it may be,  
and find that I do not feel  
as empty...  
as desolate...  
as hopeless...  
as disappointed... ... ...  
in this life...  
in people...  


And then I realize how little chance there is of that, upon writing it... The next line I'd be tempted to write, for the sake of being poetic, would be ""not as disappointed in myself""; however, I find that I am not disappointed in myself...  
Others make me want to believe it is myself I am disappointed in, but I am not. I'm proud of who I am, what I am, and we largely have no control over *what* we are... I'm finally alright with it. I don't have any real complaints. The only thing I am disappointed in myself for, at all, is having hope in people, in a humanity that I long ago chose to stay away from for a very good reason...

I do not mesh...

I don't mesh with humans.

And I no longer care if I sound alienating, because you, reading this, probably shouldn't feel that way. I'm not thinking of you. I don't know you. For all I know, you're actually alright. The people I've had the pleasure of meeting, however, are not people I am very proud of. I see a lot of love, a lot of compassion, a lot of hope and even will to be better, even be the best... But they fall short in such great ways that leave me so perplexed... It looks so easy from here. Judgmental, yes, but I've taken time to think... I know of many places where I myself am lacking. I understand it because I'm me. It's easy. For others, I have to take more thought. If I don't understand it, I can't speak of it as if I do, and therein lies the problem — I do understand it... They speak loudly enough, both with their words and their actions. And they show me that they are aware...fully aware...of what they do, how they do it, what they can do to be better for themselves and thus for others as well... And they falter... They falter on purpose. It's intentional and it's knowingly.

I wouldn't be able to live like that.

And... After being around people like this... It's brought down my own will as well...

It's hard to love someone who doesn't love themselves.

It's hard to be convinced by them that you are stupid for wanting to analyze them and life as a whole with the intention of fixing it...so convinced...through repetitive action...being ignored as a means of punishment...and then, in the end, to be told the very thing that they need to be told...

""You can't love another until you love yourself first and foremost.""

There are many ways I agree with this quote.

The main way that I disagree is when it is said towards me...because I know, inside, that I very much love myself. I can even have an ego. And it isn't out of compensation for a side of myself that I hate. I used to hate parts of myself, and I chose to fix those parts. I came clean. I became an honest person. I started to live with integrity...

The second way that I disagree with this saying is because of my experiences in life... I have found that I have felt some of the greatest love I have ever felt in life from some who have not loved themselves at all... They hated themselves... And yet, they loved me with their all. They would never stop short of showing me it each and every day. It wasn't needy. It wasn't compensating. It was a genuine love and a full love...

I'm not sure why I write like this anymore. I'm not going to impart any ""wisdom"" or knowledge to anyone because it is knowledge that is only applicable to myself and only worth something to myself.

Love is a killer...

Love is blind?

Perhaps...

It blindly swings a knife...

You have just as much chance at cutting yourself as you do at cutting another...

Love is a drug, and I'll take it, watching you sharpen knives, giving me hell, but I take it because I still have one good eye...

Lose that second eye...and you're blind. You pick up that knife, and you're swinging it right back at them. One can only hope that knife remains in the metaphorical realm and doesn't become all too real.

Most murders are a crime of passion. Killing oneself...? Oh, that's the biggest crime of passion of all...whether you love or hate yourself...you're stuck in this physical form...

And some of us just want the fuck out of here...so badly...

Someday...

Someday, I'll make the choice...

I'll take stupidity over pain.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT (below):

Every day is already a choice.  
It's a choice to stay alive.

&lt;p&gt;No one will be given a warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one will be reached out to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any other way than to just...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...be given a nudge, to see if...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re really there...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or not...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s all...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If even that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it won&amp;#39;t be thought upon for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won&amp;#39;t be drawn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be as simple as going to the fridge,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking outside,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting up a car,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a sip of water,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing a foot on the gas pedal,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling back on a trigger...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a split-second decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I myself have any warning,&lt;br/&gt;
it&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;ll have known for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like I&amp;#39;ll have enough time&lt;br/&gt;
to inform someone even if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#39;t... I don&amp;#39;t want to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My death is mine; it&amp;#39;s not yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had it my way, there would be no body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d simply disappear and be done with you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairly alienating sounding, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;ve been depressed,&lt;br/&gt;
then you know the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know...&lt;br/&gt;
It&amp;#39;s not personal...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m old enough, and have been depressed for long enough...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I know this is a whim decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A permanent fix to a temporary problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence...why I am writing this and not doing anything stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... Someday...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday, I might actually prefer a stupid decision&lt;br/&gt;
to the alternative...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live for myself, largely, but us humans, we are social creatures,&lt;br/&gt;
and (alienating again, I know) I just find that I become&lt;br/&gt;
disappointed...all too often...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy when I was a single man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lived in solitude, and it actually benefited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was still lacking...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no point going back to that,&lt;br/&gt;
and the direction of life should never&lt;br/&gt;
be backwards; it should be forwards,&lt;br/&gt;
to a new life, a new day, a new chance&lt;br/&gt;
at changing everything around,&lt;br/&gt;
and maybe, maybe, maybe,&lt;br/&gt;
one day I&amp;#39;ll wake up, live,&lt;br/&gt;
and end my day&lt;br/&gt;
just a little bit differently,&lt;br/&gt;
where I find myself sitting&lt;br/&gt;

I hardly had friends as a child, I didn't get friends until I was an adult and they are hardly friends I reach out to them and they don't reach back unless it benefits them. 

I am hardly around people so I never been good at reading social cues. 

I don't fully know what appropriate or inappropriate to say I have a really bad filter and I don't know what to filter out and my mom's always on me about it I am 22 so I should know by now but don't. 
It makes me feel bad because I am an adult, I should know better but I don't.  
I don't know how not to be awkward or weird. 

One of my younger sisters socially inept, but the rest of my siblings are socially adjusted. 


I didn't start dating until I was 19 and this affected me somewhat. 
I only been in 3 relationships so far and they all ended somewhat misfortunate. 

But my current relationship that ended really screwed me up because I didn't know what I did and he just ghosted me. 

I feel horrible about it, I really like him. 
I am very emotionally broken, I can't keep it together at all. 
I randomly just get emotional and I start crying and the other day I was sent home early from work because I couldn't stop crying. 
My mom sent me out for a few hours because I was annoying her with my crying. 

My parents were never kind to me about cry and make me close up emotionally recently I started expressing my emotions and feelings again. 

My former boyfriend didn't want to return my messages or call and thought the best option was just a ghost me and not tell me what was going on. 

Which was very horrible cause when he did last see me he knew that I was in a very bad depression rut, this whole situation just made it worse. 

I don't like self harming but it seems like the only thing that helps at the moment. 

I feel so bad I want to die. 
The worst part it seems like no one will miss me, if they don't miss or think about me while I am alive they sure as hell won't when I am dead.

&lt;p&gt;there was a person  whom I loved , and at one point there were my only reason for staying  alive , but I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it anymore (I honestly don&amp;#39;t remember what  exactly took place but I remember that I thought she deserved better  and that I can&amp;#39;t be with her until I improve myself) so I broke it off&lt;br/&gt;
it&amp;#39;s already been 3 years and the I don&amp;#39;t think I’ve changed much since then .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  just want something that I can look forward to , something that can  keep me going , I tried to make my goal: improving myself , finding  goals , and I tried to convince myself that I don&amp;#39;t need any goals  except for today&amp;#39;s goals . so, I make a plan every day and follow it.&lt;br/&gt;
but in the end what&amp;#39;s the point.&lt;/p&gt;

I also gave him some “tough love” by telling him how upset that would make me and his family. I said a lot of good things too but after some research and reading on some of these subs I realized I went about it the wrong way and probably made him feel worse. He ended up staying the night with me and his mom and dad were texting me through the night to check in.  I had to leave for a trip today without him even though he really wanted me to stay.

During those years up until I graduated, they argued a lot and my mom cried lots. In school, I tried having as much fun I could but I eventually developed social anxiety/depression, however as I met different people online and tried to improve myself, eventually got rid of those as I graduated from school. But still in school I had very few friends, when I was invited to hangouts, I wouldn't talk much or not at all. That was fine by me, had one true friend who always stuck by me so I wasn't bothered too much by it. 

Then I moved back to my own country for college but it didn't work out, I went back to Ireland and again with mom. Spent 2 years trying find job and me just sitting on the PC, I did work 2 times but they were short-lived. Then as last resort my dad offered to move live with him (in England), haven't spoken to him since I was 8. So I did, happened last year in June. Again, I had work but was for only a month. I quit because boss and its staff were really disrespectful to me and I just felt shitty working there, now I regret quitting as I could've just put up with it.

It's January now, I have went to numerous interviews, applied to 100 or less jobs on the internet while in UK, went outside and ask for one. I have almost barely any experience and no education other than highschool. I'm not exactly most outgoing or talkative but I still want to try my best at working. My dad struggles pay off rent by himself and he's always mad when I tell him I don't have anything yet. 

I'll be real, I haven't actually gone to few interviews or missed, I just don't have the motivation to try anymore. I try my best for an interview when I do go, I speak confidently and clearly (when I'm usually quiet or don't say much) I keep an eye contact, etc. It's still no good. I have few really precious friends on the internet, if it weren't for them then I probably would've fallen deep into depression again. Reason I haven't killed myself yet is I want to try my best for those around me, my dad, my mom who always cheers me on, my friends who make me smile (They don't know I feel this way though)

I'm terrible with talking about my feelings irl, next week is the week I decide to just end it once and for all or I still have hope. My mom might've job offer for me and I have an interview next week, if neither of those work out then I don't want to try anymore, partly I have brought all of this upon myself.

I feel worse and worse each day I'm not working to help out my family, I'm sure I'm not that great of a son, I never talk about my feelings and I always sound like I don't care about anything. When in fact, I feel like if I start talking about them, I might cry a lot and won't stop or I wouldn't be able to say more than 2 words before trying my best supressing tears. 

I don't know, I just feel hopeless, I know a lot of people say ''with time things get better!'' or ''sooner or later, something good is bound to happen as long you keep trying!'' Yeah, I tell the same shit to others when they are feeling hopeless and stuff. I'm not especially convinced by that myself, logically there's no guarantee something good will happen or that good things will happen. But speaking rhetorically, yeah, you're bound to have something good to happen with time, in 1 minute later, in a day, or month or 5 years later. It just doesn't fill me with hope, I'm just tired of it all, I fear death of course, nobody actually wants to die in reality and they wish things were better, circumstances just makes them feel like there's no other choice. I mean someone reading this might think I'm stupid for wanting to die because I have no job but well, trust me, I laugh at myself for that.

,SuicideWatch,"*Sorry if the context got too long, but I felt like needing to vent it all*

Since I was little, my family have told me they love me. Despite that, their actions make me think the opposite: Whether it was insulting me really often (e.g. calling me retard or mentally disabled), grounding me without justification, lying me and lying people about me, manipulating my friendships, taking away things I bought and got in my own¹ (read below for clarification), physically abusing of me (they use brute force to ""be right"", they've made lots of deep wounds and scars in my body) or simply forcing me to be in a religion, even though I peacefully told my parents I was atheist (seems like I don't have the right to believe what I truly believe on).

But they love me, right?

I don't think I ever did anything to deserve that. You see, my school grades since ever have been not only good but also perfect (10.0/10.0, yes, Mexico grades students in a 0 to 10 scale), I've never got into problems, I respect everyone the best I can, I only talk when I have well structured arguments and I try my best to be a fair human being.

¹Thanks to my good grades and performance in school, I have gotten multiple scholarships, most of them are money intended for me to spend in whatever I want. I've saved up a big percentage of it, might become useful for adulthood.

Having said that... I don't like living.

I barely got friends, and having them do not make me happy. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate them a lot, I can't thank them enough for all they've done for me. But I just don't feel ""happy"".

I suck at keeping a friendship for long, people tend to get tired of me because no matter what they do, their actions get do not get actual positive impact in me. (There's an exception, my longest friendship is almost 10 years). I'm not even gonna mention how bad I am for love relationships, I've never got a girlfriend.

I used to enjoy videogames a lot, but at some point of my life I stopped feeling satisfaction from playing them, no matter how many I bought.

Through all my life I've tried out a lot of different hobbies, which includes but does not limit to watching anime, 3d modeling, frontend web developer for a social media, programming a Discord bot, creating videos for YouTube, making my own videogame, making a SM64 rom hack, holding a 400ish users community back in Google Plus, learning a second language (English), unsuccessfully trying to learn a third language (Japanese), drawing, making music and etc. Though, none of this made me feel fulfilled, instead I felt like I was going nowhere.

I'm good at school only because I'm afraid to be a failure in life, plus anxiety (I think that's what it is, correct me if I'm wrong) overwhelms me when I have pending tasks (like homework) with excessive disappointment thoughts. But I'm not aiming at anything in life, I'm fine with whatever it turns into as long I somehow find happiness out there.

I'm naturally sad, due to my familiar situation described above.

At first, I thought this was a temporary mood, but since it has sticked on me for 5+ years I'm starting to consider I might have depression.

There have been moments in my life where I plan a detailed suicide scenario but I haven't gotten to execute any of these ideas yet. Being honest here, I'm cowardly afraid of killing myself, I'd rather to get killed by someone or something else.

I just want to be happy but it's hard to believe it'll ever happen, I know I'm still young, yet I seriously dislike living. As I said in the title, I don't know where to go in life but I can't stay here.

It sounds dumb I know but, there's something I still enjoy, which is eating food like tacos, hamburgers and chilaquiles. Though it is not enough reason to make me want to stay alive.

If I could think on anything that might have the emotional weight to change how I see life, it would be getting a girlfriend later in life.

Thank you for reading this. Don't worry about my suicide thoughts, I'm doing my best to avoid suicide for now.

PD: Hands hurt. Eyes hurt. I want to sleep, I made it to almost 3 a.m. by thinking and writing this post.",t2_55qbl6gh,False,,0,False,"It feels like I'm filling a car's fuel tank full...

&lt;p&gt;Since I was little, my family have told me they love me. Despite that, their actions make me think the opposite: Whether it was insulting me really often (e.g. calling me retard or mentally disabled), grounding me without justification, lying me and lying people about me, manipulating my friendships, taking away things I bought and got in my own¹ (read below for clarification), physically abusing of me (they use brute force to &amp;quot;be right&amp;quot;, they&amp;#39;ve made lots of deep wounds and scars in my body) or simply forcing me to be in a religion, even though I peacefully told my parents I was atheist (seems like I don&amp;#39;t have the right to believe what I truly believe on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they love me, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I ever did anything to deserve that. You see, my school grades since ever have been not only good but also perfect (10.0/10.0, yes, Mexico grades students in a 0 to 10 scale), I&amp;#39;ve never got into problems, I respect everyone the best I can, I only talk when I have well structured arguments and I try my best to be a fair human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¹Thanks to my good grades and performance in school, I have gotten multiple scholarships, most of them are money intended for me to spend in whatever I want. I&amp;#39;ve saved up a big percentage of it, might become useful for adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that... I don&amp;#39;t like living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely got friends, and having them do not make me happy. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I appreciate them a lot, I can&amp;#39;t thank them enough for all they&amp;#39;ve done for me. But I just don&amp;#39;t feel &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suck at keeping a friendship for long, people tend to get tired of me because no matter what they do, their actions get do not get actual positive impact in me. (There&amp;#39;s an exception, my longest friendship is almost 10 years). I&amp;#39;m not even gonna mention how bad I am for love relationships, I&amp;#39;ve never got a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to enjoy videogames a lot, but at some point of my life I stopped feeling satisfaction from playing them, no matter how many I bought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through all my life I&amp;#39;ve tried out a lot of different hobbies, which includes but does not limit to watching anime, 3d modeling, frontend web developer for a social media, programming a Discord bot, creating videos for YouTube, making my own videogame, making a SM64 rom hack, holding a 400ish users community back in Google Plus, learning a second language (English), unsuccessfully trying to learn a third language (Japanese), drawing, making music and etc. Though, none of this made me feel fulfilled, instead I felt like I was going nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m good at school only because I&amp;#39;m afraid to be a failure in life, plus anxiety (I think that&amp;#39;s what it is, correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong) overwhelms me when I have pending tasks (like homework) with excessive disappointment thoughts. But I&amp;#39;m not aiming at anything in life, I&amp;#39;m fine with whatever it turns into as long I somehow find happiness out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m naturally sad, due to my familiar situation described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought this was a temporary mood, but since it has sticked on me for 5+ years I&amp;#39;m starting to consider I might have depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been moments in my life where I plan a detailed suicide scenario but I haven&amp;#39;t gotten to execute any of these ideas yet. Being honest here, I&amp;#39;m cowardly afraid of killing myself, I&amp;#39;d rather to get killed by someone or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to be happy but it&amp;#39;s hard to believe it&amp;#39;ll ever happen, I know I&amp;#39;m still young, yet I seriously dislike living. As I said in the title, I don&amp;#39;t know where to go in life but I can&amp;#39;t stay here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds dumb I know but, there&amp;#39;s something I still enjoy, which is eating food like tacos, hamburgers and chilaquiles. Though it is not enough reason to make me want to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could think on anything that might have the emotional weight to change how I see life, it would be getting a girlfriend later in life. It isn&amp;#39;t something 100% sure, as I have fear of it either not working or negatively affecting me, but I want to clear out that possibility before ending my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this. Don&amp;#39;t worry about my suicide thoughts, I&amp;#39;m doing my best to avoid suicide for now.&lt;/p&gt;

It is practically impossible to have a relationship with her, when I see that she does not have much time to get on the phone due to priorities. She said it is because of her studies, and I believe her. I already installed several applications on my phone to see if they helped me, but without any result, funny that I only managed to like two people in this entire country.

Today it is no longer the same. I want to escape this thought of wanting to kill myself because I know that the current problems will get worse in the future and will consequently affect my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I moved to Portugal I live with that and I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain why I diminished this desire to create friendships or even serious relationships. About wanting to have serious relationships, I like a girl, she sings in the choir with me. Unfortunately, I am still anxious and introverted. It is practically impossible to have a relationship with her, when I see that she does not have much time to get on the phone due to priorities. She said it is because of her studies, and I believe her. I already installed several applications on my phone to see if they helped me, but without any result, funny that I only managed to like two people in this entire country. I lived 20 years locked inside my room playing games and making friends online, unfortunately I see that it is over and I want help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"All I have to do now is get my address updated, pick the thing up and I'll be done with the bureaucratic part of getting a gun. So that I can kill myself the right way. In a way that will actually work, but won't completely blow my head off like a shotgun will.

I used to think that if I got a decent job and got to move out on my own I'd be happy. Like I'd become a different person. A person I'd actually like to be. Someone who can make friends. Like real friends, close ones and girlfriends. Not just getting along with people at work.

Looking back I've been doing this all my life. High school sucks and people are shallow, but it ends and it will get better I used to tell myself. Then it ended, I went to college and I was still a lazy coward. I blamed still having to live at home with parents to save money. Can't get a girl if you have to take her back to your parents place to do anything right? Yeah, that's the excuse I told myself for never trying at all. 

Then that ended and now I live alone. I have a respectable job that supports me. Same deal, still alone just like always and honestly much fewer ways to meet people, women especially, than when I was in school. But that's not the problem. That's just a new excuse. The problem is me. The lazy, depressed for no reason sack of shit I am. The problem is I won't try, because I'm lazy and afraid.

I could try dating apps, but do I? No. I sit alone in my house, this place that I used to be so happy to have, but now feels like a prison that I confine myself to; just like what happened with my job. I pine after the idea of having a girlfriend or friends to hang out with as if that will be the thing that makes everything better. I bitch about it online like I'm doing now. It's probably a blessing that I'm so intimidated and don't try because being with me would probably be awful. I'd become a terrible boyfriend, just like I became a terrible employee at a job I used to care so much for. I'll probably get fired soon. I kinda hope I do.

It doesn't matter. I'll learn to hate any situation I'm in and anyone I get to care about me will suffer seeing me suffer for stupid, nothing reasons.

I don't want to drag myself into work everyday and do that boring job for the better part of the day, so I can go home and distract myself with a game I don't care about or some movie or show. This isn't the life I want to live, but it's the best I know how to get and at this point all I really want is to just go to sleep and not wake up. 

That won't happen to a healthy 24 year old, so I'm getting the gun.

No. I sit alone in my house, this place that I used to be so happy to have, but now feels like a prison that I confine myself to; just like what happened with my job. I pine after the idea of having a girlfriend or friends to hang out with as if that will be the thing that makes everything better. I bitch about it online like I&amp;#39;m doing now. It&amp;#39;s probably a blessing that I&amp;#39;m so intimidated and don&amp;#39;t try because being with me would probably be awful. I&amp;#39;d become a terrible boyfriend, just like I became a terrible employee at a job I used to care so much for. I&amp;#39;ll probably get fired soon. I kinda hope I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter. I&amp;#39;ll learn to hate any situation I&amp;#39;m in and anyone I get to care about me will suffer seeing me suffer for stupid, nothing reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to drag myself into work everyday and do that boring job for the better part of the day, so I can go home and distract myself with a game I don&amp;#39;t care about or some movie or show. This isn&amp;#39;t the life I want to live, but it&amp;#39;s the best I know how to get and at this point all I really want is to just go to sleep and not wake up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That won&amp;#39;t happen to a healthy 24 year old, so I&amp;#39;m getting the gun. I really, really hope death is oblivion, but even if it&amp;#39;s not then I have to die at some point, so why not go ahead, die quickly and spare myself and everyone else the part where I have to live?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

One year ago today I was in a horrible place. All I thought about was how to kms, even wanting/anticipating to suffer the pain of doing so. Because I was in physical pain every day just by living, I wanted to hurt even more as I died. Thought of many ways on how to do it. I had majored in psych to see what was wrong with me- I self-diagnosed it as a milder case of quiet borderline personality disorder. I'd had the hardest year ever- I was away from home in a foreign country having run away to China, severed all ties with my family, missing my dad who had passed away. I was scammed out of his insurance money he had left to me. My apartment caught on fire when the water heater sparked somehow and I had to pay damages to the management, money I didn't have. In serious debt. My dog who had been my best friend for 13 years fell ill and eventually passed away as well. My work-from-home job was in a lull. And finally, my bf cheated on me and blamed me for it. I ran away to a different city and just thought about dying. I'd sleep all day and at night, walk the track at a nearby high school for hours after midnight, blasting sad music into my earbuds and crying for the ex. That was the BPD fear of abandonment. I would never meet anyone as good as him, I'd do anything to take him back. I'd run, telling myself I was running towards my goal of reconciliation with him, and my throat would burn and I would just sob my heart out every day. I cut myself often and watched my blood run. That was one year ago.

It's one year later. Some stuff has changed, some hasn't. Still in debt, still in this city, now we are having a virus outbreak. But now I don't think about kms for some reason. Life is not good- I need to pay back people and I still miss the ex, although I have come to realize I wouldn't be happy with him. But I remember how raw it was to dream of suicide every single day, and wish I could help others. I don't know why I am writing this- maybe I just hope someone will believe me that sometimes we can, mysteriously, somehow, automatically, just transition out of the thought that suicide is the only solution. Now, I have met a couple new friends. An apartment I love. A life/relationship coach. Adopted a slinky kitten with an attitude problem. Life just kind of flows slowly, but not angrily or miserably. I'm more numb than falling apart. I try hard to focus on work and progress rather than dwell on or imagine hurtful things that will send me spiraling down towards suicidal thoughts or cutting. It sounds generic, and I never intended to want to get better. I really just wanted to die. But now, I actually wish to be happy. This feeling, before I knew it, developed by itself in my subconscious.

If you want to get better, I think writing helps a lot. My counselor told me that we often interpret an action or words to interpret an entire situation, convincing ourselves that it's the truth. Writing helps me think out my issues and I realize I often think myself into some ugly boxes.

I used to think it was like water dripping into a glass- you can only hold so much sadness before you overflow or break or die. I still kind of think that, but meeting another person who was also deeply suicidal and clinically depressed, and also reading certain psych books, taught me that in the end we all want to love and be loved.

I am currently in my 2nd year of university studying mathematics. I barely scraped by last semester and really hurt my GPA which is super important for the grad school I wanna get into. There's still enough time to pull it up, but I decided to take a light 12 credit semester of only easy classes (none of my difficult theoretical math ones) in order to address my mental health challenges.

I feel like I've tried everything. I went to a therapist for 3 years before I moved out and have been going to a new one the past year and a half. I've tried 3 major classes of antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, and TeCAs - 4 drugs total). Last week I tried Cymbalta for the first time and had such bad startup side effects I had to discontinue after a week. I've tried exercising (both lifting and running) for over a year. I only have 2 friends who I see once a week and feel alone pretty much every day. Tomorrow I have another psychiatrist appointment and don't really know what to do. I'm not sure if I want to try another drug in the middle of the semester given how much the startup side effects further impact my school work.

I'm watching every aspect of my life deteriorate and as I continue to underachieve due to depression. It can take 6 hrs to get out of bed, I haven't done my dishes in months, lack the motivation to do basic life tasks like food shopping (let alone serious prolonged work), and all my social interactions are suffering.

I'm reaching out because... I actually don't know why. Do I think that things will get better? No, but do I wish that I was that one in the billion to strike jackpot, yes, but is it likely, no.

I haven't had a good time in a long time, whether it's not fitting in, bullying, not feeling like I matter, the most recent issue is romantic relationships.  I never asked for this existence and yet here I am, not particularly enjoying this existence, I wish my mum did abort me when she wanted to, her moment of weakness doomed me to this life.  I'm alive because I have to, not because I want to, for me suicide seem to be the great liberation more than any acts of living ever did/will.

All I can say is thank fuck for gun control, or maybe it's a curse that I live in a country with strict gun control. Maybe this will be one of the last trace of evidence of my existence, idk.

I made the decision a couple of years back to stay in this shitty little rural town. I thought I wasn't ready to leave, so I figured I'd stay and work on myself a bit.

Turns out that was the worst decision I've ever made. I even had adequate funds to get out of this place.

No access to medical facilities where people don't treat you like garbage, no access to healthy produce unless you want to travel three hours to civilization and three hours back, no access to any music or art facilities to help me get back to what I actually enjoy. And no people really worth spending time with.

Either I’m afraid of it not working and I have to face the consequences or how it will effect my friends. I really don’t know.

I have a broken foot, so I haven't been able to do something so human as walking. It's been six weeks and I'm not healing at all. Being mostly chair- and walker-bound forces a lot of thoughts into your head. 

I feel stuck, and abandoned. Like I need a safe place to just fall into and cry with someone I know won't leave me, but don't feel allowed to. Just pinning the tears back in place, repeatedly.

First semester in the new school was fucking miserable for me.

I think I'm just too fucking dumb for my school, even for fucking life.

I feel like a fat, lazy and pathetic loser who spends all his time sitting behind a computer.

I'm even too fucking scared to ask him to help me with it, I don't even know how to study, my grades are on the edge, all my math grades are only 1's (F's), I even tried to correct some of them, but when I saw the test I just left the class and skipped the day of school (the corrections of grades are mostly early in the morning).
My parents really don't support me, they think my anxiety is some kind of construct that I just create for excuses. They can't seem to understand that I don't want to be a fucking Christian, when I skip school and tell them that i feel like a complete shit they punish me for it and say things like - stop whining, I'll throw your computer out of the window etc. I cry myself to sleep almost everyday thinking of ways to end my life and I hope I won't wake up.

With that being said, I am looking for advice with regards to my current situation. I am currently a junior in college who is going through what can only be described as a depressive episode. I also struggle with anxiety, and I got help with that past summer. Now my depression seems to be getting worse; I struggle with lethargy and low energy and have a lot of trouble leaving bed in the morning. I'm also very irritable and have an extremely difficult time focusing on anything which is extremely problematic considering I am in upper-level English and philosophy classes. On top of that, I've been procrastinating on my studies which is compounding my feelings of worthlessness. I am also having thoughts of taking my own life, and these thoughts have been increasing as of late. I feel as if all my confidence has been removed from my body and soul. I also feel like one of the worst people on the face of the Earth; like I am subhuman and will never truly relate to or fit in with anybody; like I am fundamentally flawed.

I'm only 15, I've tried going through moods like this before, and they always vary in length. Sometimes it only takes a weekend for it to go over, others a week, a month and the worst I've experienced was about 1,5 years. I can't cope, and I feel like a real dipshit for even hating everything. I feel incredibly unlucky, but at the same time, there are so many people who are way worse off than me. It's like I'm berating myself and walking forward at the same time. I've somehow managed to make suicidal jokes and general red flags a normal part of my behaviour and humour, so nobody ever catches on. I don't know a single person I can truly talk to, I've never had a best friend, a girlfriend or even a strong bond with a family member. I just feel alone, and sometimes I feel like I deserve it.  


I'm generally seen as a confident fuckhead who's immune to being depressed. And I truly do act confident as hell, but it's just an act, I second doubt myself all the time even though I press forward. Every few years I look back at myself and hate the person I was, well knowing I'm someday going to hate the person I am now even more than I do so now.   


I hate the fact that I know I'm wrong but I can't change how I feel, I hate the fact that this feeling will probably go away in a week and come back another week later. It's just tiring, it's lonely, it's stupid and frustrating. I get tired of everything I do, I want to have intimate relationships with people, but I can't feel any special way towards anyone I know. 

I somehow manage to be extroverted and, I'm good at talking to people, yet I have no real confidence. I'm supposed to have a bright future, there's a decent bit expected of me, and I have high goals for myself too, but I just lack any motivation to fufill said goals. I'm always in on the banter when we start berating eachtoher at school, but I can't help but let certain things get to me. I always feel sort of feel like the bad type of ""special"". People look up to me in certain things, hell even admire me and seek my advise, but on a personal level, and the context of a relationship, I can't help but think they don't care much for me. I don't remember the last time I did something with anybody 1 on 1 outside of school or family. My family life is also a bit odd. My father never disowned me, I disowned him first after he threatened to do so to me. My dad and mom weren't ever really together, and at some point I realized that my dad didn't actually care for me, he wanted to use me for citizenship. Nobody ever planted this idea in my head, it was something I realized myself by the way he talked and interracted with me. My mom was never much of a motherfigure, the emotional role of my parents were replaced by my much older siblings, but they're still siblings. I've never really had a role model, nobody to run to or seek honest advice from. My most genuine bond is with my brother, idk how to describe our relationship, but he did some of the things for me, which a dad is supposed to do. He gave me ""The talk"", I had my first drink with him, and he has explained some aspects of social life and other personal skills. But he's still just my brother, and there'll always be that fine line.  


I'm a short, asthmatic, extroverted, insecure, unmotivated, lonely 15 year old fucking guy, who's tired of everything, but I somehow lack any desire to end it. I'm not indifferent to life, I just keep on being in this fucking cycle of self hatred and judgement without any kind irl support.  


I have online friends who know me better than my own family, yet I've never fully exposed myself, because the more I dig the more I find, and it's fucking terrifying yet it makes me feel stupid. Everyone experiences shit like I do, I'm definitely not alone when it comes to this terrible fucking feeling, so why can't I break free. And my coping only works for so long, I've never managed to enjoy a game or an activity for more than a year, slowly and slowly everything just stops working. Feeling happy is a rare pleasure to me, when I don't feel loney, I just feel fine, indifferent. The problem is just when I get tired of said feeling, just feeling ""ok"" gets strangely old and miserable.  


I really want a close connection to someone, yet I can't for the love of everything I hold dear, create one. I'm sort of grateful for said online friends for the emotional support, some of them even opened up to me about their shit. And it felt nice, talking about shit feels nice, finding comfort in eachothers shared pain works surprisingly well, it's just sad when you can't ever truly know the other person since it's over the bloody internet. I just really wish I had someone in real life who got me, who would open up to me and embrace our shared hellish, stupid and first world problem filled lives.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a short, asthmatic, extroverted, insecure, unmotivated, lonely 15 year old fucking guy, who&amp;#39;s tired of everything, but I somehow lack any desire to end it. I&amp;#39;m not indifferent to life, I just keep on being in this fucking cycle of self hatred and judgement without any kind irl support.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have online friends who know me better than my own family, yet I&amp;#39;ve never fully exposed myself, because the more I dig the more I find, and it&amp;#39;s fucking terrifying yet it makes me feel stupid. Everyone experiences shit like I do, I&amp;#39;m definitely not alone when it comes to this terrible fucking feeling, so why can&amp;#39;t I break free. And my coping only works for so long, I&amp;#39;ve never managed to enjoy a game or an activity for more than a year, slowly and slowly everything just stops working. Feeling happy is a rare pleasure to me, when I don&amp;#39;t feel loney, I just feel fine, indifferent. The problem is just when I get tired of said feeling, just feeling &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot; gets strangely old and miserable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really want a close connection to someone, yet I can&amp;#39;t for the love of everything I hold dear, create one. I&amp;#39;m sort of grateful for said online friends for the emotional support, some of them even opened up to me about their shit. And it felt nice, talking about shit feels nice, finding comfort in eachothers shared pain works surprisingly well, it&amp;#39;s just sad when you can&amp;#39;t ever truly know the other person since it&amp;#39;s over the bloody internet. I just really wish I had someone in real life who got me, who would open up to me and embrace our shared hellish, stupid and first world problem filled lives.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know if this belongs here, because I am not considering killing myself, but I just want an outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"When we first got engaged, my fiance (XY) and I (XX) were excited about getting married and having kids.  We'd decided on having two or three.  We picked out prospective names.  We talked about the things we wanted to do with them when the kids were little, how we'd handle problems, the whole nine yards.  But a few months ago, my fiance changed their mind: they don't want kids any more.  The reason?  They're trans, they feel like they can't/don't want to transition, and the only way they feel they can cope with dysphoria is by having an extensive appropriate-gender life online, and having a child would destroy their coping time.  So...that's that.

Ever since, I've been thinking about how this is going to go over with our families.  My fiance's family is very close-knit and traditional Catholic.  They expect us to have kids, and after a while of not producing grandbabies they will start asking probing questions.  My fiance thinks no one's going to ask (they will, they ask about *everything else*, they won't not ask about this) and that if they do ask we should just say that we've decided that we won't have kids...but I can't keep up that lie beyond an initial front.  *We* didn't decide anything, and the reason my fiance decided on not having kids isn't one we can share with their family.  The best alternative option I can think of is that we lie and say I'm barren (no one would believe my fiance is biologically incapable, big Catholic family there), but my fiance isn't willing to go with that lie.

I know that with my fiance's plan, my fiance's family will eventually decide that I'm at fault, that I convinced their child to not be a parent.  And they *will* take it out on me, and I don't think I can handle being frozen out like that for long.  If I died somehow--ideally in an accident, or some disease--no one would blame my fiance for not having children or staying single until everyone in their reasonable dating pool was too old for children; they'd just be a victim of tragedy.

I'm not thinking of killing myself today, or tomorrow, or this year.  But in a few years, when the questions and the pain and the biting comments and icy glares get too much, if I haven't gotten lucky enough to die first, I'm going to have to do something about it.

,SuicideWatch,"This time last year, I was a dude who’d just turned 15 and I was so suicidal that I dropped out of school, got immediate help. I’ve got trauma from when I was a little kid, I’ve been treated like shit my entire life. The therapy I had for a few months didn’t help in any way, I feel like I can’t be fixed. So 6 months go by and I enroll into a new school, around that time I stopped going to therapy but kept seeing a psychiatrist. Getting diagnosed with ADHD a couple of months ago helped and for 6 weeks up until a couple of weeks ago I was on Ritalin, now I’m on Vyvanse. It’s helped my grades, made me more social slightly less anxious but that’s it. I’ve lived here for about 2.5 years, I was born here and my mum’s from here but I didn’t grow up here and in no way do I fit in. This has resulted in being bullied a little, but the main trouble is with friendships and socialising. I’ve got a bunch of ‘friends’ who are fake as fuck, I’m treated like a joke down here. I’m in an even worse place (in my life) than I was a year ago, I don’t want emergency treatment again because I know it’s not for me. Being in the UK, I’d much rather the NHS help some kid who would benefit and enough resources have been on me. I’ve had CBT, psychotherapy and another type. Nothing will truly heal me. My psychiatrist talked about SSRI’s, I don’t know if I want to be dependent on another pill. And even if I do, it’ll take at least 4 months for an appointment and probably just under a year for the actual prescription, let alone settling on a medication (trial and error), I know this because it was the exact same with my ADHD medication. I do not know what to do, as much as I’m super suicidal and depressed, I don’t wanna tell someone and go back to CAMHS (name of U.K. mental health clinics), I can’t do it. Been smoking a lot of pot lately, just to escape. I haven’t noticed any memory issues and my short term memory’s always great (even after having used for months), but I’m scared it’s doing some sort of damage. I don’t smoke cigs because of what I’ve seen them do to those within my family, nor do I drink. That helps keep me alive, I’ve never fallen into the trap of smoking cigs and I’m proud of myself for it. I eat very healthy, I’m physically active and I try to meditate every once in a while. I’ve had a blood test and I’m physically OK. I keep getting flashbacks and I’m heartbroken over so many things. 
I don’t know where I’m heading, I could stay in high school for another few months and then go to college, or stay in high school for another year and a half and then go to uni. But more hell might fully break me, I don’t think I can take much more. I live in a dark, lonely, cold and drug filled town and that probably plays a huge role.

I’ve got trauma from when I was a little kid, I’ve been treated like shit my entire life. The therapy I had for a few months didn’t help in any way, I feel like I can’t be fixed. So 6 months go by and I enroll into a new school, around that time I stopped going to therapy but kept seeing a psychiatrist. Getting diagnosed with ADHD a couple of months ago helped and for 6 weeks up until a couple of weeks ago I was on Ritalin, now I’m on Vyvanse. It’s helped my grades, made me more social slightly less anxious but that’s it. I’ve lived here for about 2.5 years, I was born here and my mum’s from here but I didn’t grow up here and in no way do I fit in. This has resulted in being bullied a little, but the main trouble is with friendships and socialising. I’ve got a bunch of ‘friends’ who are fake as fuck, I’m treated like a joke down here. I’m in an even worse place (in my life) than I was a year ago, I don’t want emergency treatment again because I know it’s not for me. Being in the UK, I’d much rather the NHS help some kid who would benefit and enough resources have been on me. I’ve had CBT, psychotherapy and another type. Nothing will truly heal me. My psychiatrist talked about SSRI’s, I don’t know if I want to be dependent on another pill. And even if I do, it’ll take at least 4 months for an appointment and probably just under a year for the actual prescription, let alone settling on a medication (trial and error), I know this because it was the exact same with my ADHD medication. I do not know what to do, as much as I’m super suicidal and depressed, I don’t wanna tell someone and go back to CAMHS (name of U.K. mental health clinics), I can’t do it. Been smoking a lot of pot lately, just to escape. I haven’t noticed any memory issues and my short term memory’s always great (even after having used for months), but I’m scared it’s doing some sort of damage. I don’t smoke cigs because of what I’ve seen them do to those within my family, nor do I drink. That helps keep me alive, I’ve never fallen into the trap of smoking cigs and I’m proud of myself for it. I eat very healthy, I’m physically active and I try to meditate every once in a while. I’ve had a blood test and I’m physically OK. I keep getting flashbacks and I’m heartbroken over so many things. 
I don’t know where I’m heading, I could stay in high school for another few months and then go to college, or stay in high school for another year and a half and then go to uni. But more hell might fully break me, I don’t think I can take much more. I live in a dark, lonely, cold and drug filled town and that probably plays a huge role. I’ve hit rock bottom at 16, nobody can truly help me. The ironic thing is, I’m only staying alive for the people who are mainly responsible for doing this to me. Yes, I’m no longer a kid and am about to be a grown ass man. I should grow up, and chill out. But how can I? I’m wasting my best years of my life and everything’s going to shit.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hello suicide watch, my old friend. I once again have never felt worse in my life. Where do I even start. I would start as usual with how hideously fat and disgusting I am but I feel like that’s not even the reason I’m suicidal this time. Maybe part of it, but not the overwhelming factor.

     Let’s start with my personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder, which is the root cause of all this and what brings me back to the brink of suicide month after month. Once again, I fell in love way too quickly and became obsessive. It’s time to be honest and tell it for what it is. Men control my life. They control how I see myself, my happiness, my self worth, my joy, everything. I scream internally when I get a new crush/obsession because I know it’s going to start a deep, dark downward spiral which only inevitably ends in contemplating suicide because the target of my affections is always someone unavailable to love me back in the way I need to be loved. I have been in therapy since the age of 16 on and off, tried several medications, been in the mental hospital three times, and nothing has ever helped long term. I do feel better for short spurts, but then i meet another man and the cycle starts all over again.

     The only good thing about this time around is I finally realized what is causing these cycles. It’s not even that I am trying to meet men every time I “imprint” on a new one. It could be as simple as someone I work with. Everything is fine and then one day...it’s not. I’m googling them, Facebook stalking, checking their snap score, LinkedIn, maybe even doing a background check. I’m certifiably insane and no one who knows me even realizes the extent of it. I’m an absolute psycho and the world would probably be better off without me anyway. I don’t see how this disorder can ever be cured. My brain is broken.

       Now let’s talk about my past. I’ve been raped more times than I can count, groomed by older men in my childhood, abused, beaten, taken advantage of in every which way. My college rape freshman year was the worst one. That’s when I knew there was no coming back. It’s like I knew I was going to destroy my life or die trying. I know I am smart and some days I envision doing amazing things, like studying public health at Hopkins. Other days I just want to jump off the Ambassador bridge. Today is one of those days. I am in so much emotional pain I can feel it physically and I can’t stand it anymore. 

      I also carry around massive amounts of guilt. My brother is headed to federal prison soon, and I can’t help but think if I hadn’t been such a shitty and dramatic sister maybe my parents would have been able to pay him more attention and realize he was fucked up too. My family’s broken up over this. I keep imagining the day he was taken away, and I can’t stop crying.

       It’s really just a big mess of everything at this point and I can’t pinpoint the one factor that is making me want to end it all.

My brother will. My boyfriend. My best friend. My cousins. That is a lot of people who love me and look up to me and think the world of me.

I wish I didn't have them. I wish they'd all hate me. I wish I didn't have this thing blocking me I wish I could just die.

,SuicideWatch,"My day started of quite bad. I got called by my best friend (male) at midnight. He sounded totally shitfaced. There were a lot of background noise and a lot of talking. He asked me if I was awake and alone at 00:15. Which I said ""yes?"" to. I had no idea what was going on. Then all of a sudden a girl started talking to him and hung up the phone. Cue panic attack. Like wtf was that all about. I texted him ""okay?"" about fifteen minutes later.

Around five I woke up because I felt like I was going to throw up and saw that I had two unread messages from him. In an almost unreadable text he said ""huh, have I called you? Oof"" (translated from another language).

I wasn't able to sleep for almost an hour because ya ""boi"" had another panic attack while in bed.

Then I woke up at around 14:45 I woke up because I had to pee. Dropped my phone on my way to the bathroom and found out that my bank card is gone. (Card is supposed to be in the little pocket on the case). Went upstairs to tell mom, while having a full on panic attack, only to find my aunt and grandmother in the living room. Guess who decided to invite family over for dinner without telling me (and mom).

I have been diagnosed with autism, so the change in my plans caused an even bigger panic attack. Yay me.

Three hours later (after dinner), a different ""friend"" sent me a long video of him lip syncing to ""make you mine"" by PUBLIC. I hate getting videos of him. It makes me sick to my stomach. You may think ""what's the problem here?"". He's in his thirties. I'm still a couple of years away from 20. I've told him so many times I don't want him as a boyfriend. (1 because of age difference. 2 We live in different countries. 3 I'm into girls.)

So anyway, after I had to painstakingly watch my way through that video, I sent him a snap saying ""I do not enjoy videos from you"". He read it wrong and thought I said that I do enjoy getting videos from him. Se sent the video in chat and saved it together with a cheesy paragraph basically saying ""since you loved the video so much I'll save it here so you can watch it whenever you're feeling down. I love you lots.""
After I corrected him, he got all sad and said ""well shit 💔"". I muted him again at that point.

A few hours passed and I thought that was it for the day, but oh boy were I wrong. I watched a r/wholesomememes video by The Click. I thought it'd make me happy, but it just made me cry more and more. That's what happens when you bottle up emotions for months. At the end of the video I was just full on ugly crying. I put on my favourite album by xxxtentacion, as you do when you see no end to your suffering. I ended up ugly crying for half an hour while listening to 17 on repeat.

After I cleaned up my tears and blew my nose, I just sat at my bed for a while. Tried to watch videos, but I just felt dead. No spark in my eyes, no smile, no laughter, no emotion. Just dead, but breathing.

Then I cut myself. Once, twice, more and more, the blood started dripping quicker and quicker. I stopped and got some paper towels because, ya know, don't want to leave any blood on the clean bedsheets.

I can't afford a therapist in this country and my university's mental health support is a bad joke. People in this university kill themselves regularly and all they do is wash their hands with this issue. Absolutely no help for us. They just want our money and that's it, they don't even treat us like humans, we're just numbers in their bank accounts.

I know everyone talks about how suicide can never be an option and it's ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" or whatever, but maybe, if we are to think rationally, without involving emotion (I know, easier said than done, but yeah), can't we acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, it could be for the better for some people? Even if I pull through, all these years of depression, anxiety, stress and a crippling cigarette addiction are sure to come back to bite me one day. I'm not set to live a long life anyway, I'll get a stroke or heart attack or whatever in max 20 years and I'd honestly rather die now, with dignity and integrity, rather than live my last days incapacitated on a hospital bed.

And I don't give a fuck about the afterlife, I fear no Gods. All I yearn for is the beautiful tranquility of death, that one moment when I close my eyes for the last time and my inner voice whispers to me ""It's over, all of your problems are no more"" (might not be anywhere close to how it feels like to die, but that's just the way I fantasize it and hey, it's beautiful).

I have friends, that's the one  thing I can't complain about in life. They are the most beautiful and lovely people you'll ever meet. The only drawback to my suicide is having them and my family(even though our relationship isn't exactly great, but I still love them and I know that so do they) suffer. I would hate that. But I feel like they would understand. They would understand that I just couldn't bear anymore and that this was indeed the best solution for me. None of them are exactly strangers to my condition, you know, and they do their best to help, and I appreciate that more than I could ever express in words, but, you know, there are some things that no one can figure out for you.

Click on the speed up button and now it's after term 2 examinations and I failed 3 tests and the grades are as the following 24% in Arabic first language (Our teacher helped pick the hardest past paper in recent history and he even admited to that.), 35% in accounting(So if it was during an actual igsce I would've probably passed) and a 40% in bio.The passed subjects had a grade the following 80% english as a second language, 65% math core, 51% business and a 53% in Ict so even the passed subjects don't help.


Minutes ago my father started to get angry(His pupils widened, tone and speed change plus he started to do the good ol fashion attempted investigation) and asked about my grades and me being me(the complete dumbass who can't handle any pressure he throws) started to stutter around and gave him facts that sounded like straight up lies(they were facts but I stuttered and stumbled). He has a meeting on Wednesday and already told me to pack up most of the ""fancy tech""(I put it in apostrophes because it's just a monitor, desktop, mouse and keyboard and the rest are obviously things being moved around) so I believe I am royally fucked.


Not only did I under achieve this term but I also missed out on some classwork that its issue has being discussed last term so seeing it reoccur could add more fuel to the fire. I know I am stumbling on my words and missing the point but I all wanted to say is that I am really scared of what my actions have lead up to and knowing my dad I am in a certain level of physical danger. I usually try to help people with this type of issue but at this point I am slowly embracing the fact that my teenager issues are not teenager issues as much as a bunch of other stuff piling up and breaking at the smallest things, giving it the teenager label.

&lt;p&gt;Click on the speed up button and now it&amp;#39;s after term 2 examinations and I failed 3 tests and the grades are as the following 24% in Arabic first language (Our teacher helped pick the hardest past paper in recent history and he even admited to that.), 35% in accounting(So if it was during an actual igsce I would&amp;#39;ve probably passed) and a 40% in bio.The passed subjects had a grade the following 80% english as a second language, 65% math core, 51% business and a 53% in Ict so even the passed subjects don&amp;#39;t help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minutes ago my father started to get angry(His pupils widened, tone and speed change plus he started to do the good ol fashion attempted investigation) and asked about my grades and me being me(the complete dumbass who can&amp;#39;t handle any pressure he throws) started to stutter around and gave him facts that sounded like straight up lies(they were facts but I stuttered and stumbled). He has a meeting on Wednesday and already told me to pack up most of the &amp;quot;fancy tech&amp;quot;(I put it in apostrophes because it&amp;#39;s just a monitor, desktop, mouse and keyboard and the rest are obviously things being moved around) so I believe I am royally fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did I under achieve this term but I also missed out on some classwork that its issue has being discussed last term so seeing it reoccur could add more fuel to the fire. I know I am stumbling on my words and missing the point but I all wanted to say is that I am really scared of what my actions have lead up to and knowing my dad I am in a certain level of physical danger. I usually try to help people with this type of issue but at this point I am slowly embracing the fact that my teenager issues are not teenager issues as much as a bunch of other stuff piling up and breaking at the smallest things, giving it the teenager label.&lt;/p&gt;

I did the exact same thing to a girl I loved not 3 months after that started and I’ve been in complete pain for the past year and a half, every day every hour, holding onto that and unable to fix anything. I don’t have a job I can do because I’ve been so mentally wounded by that to the point where I can’t do a simple task without feeling so much anxiety I get a mental breakdown full of tears and hyperventilation after the shift, making less than a hundred bucks that day. I can’t make friends because of that anxiety and I can’t even talk to people anymore the way I used to because my brain explodes when I try. I have nobody. I don’t have weed, I don’t have drinks, I don’t have friends to help. I am alone. I sat outside a church last night crying and seeing no purpose in my life, finally breaking down after a year.

That’s why you’re great! Nobody is like you. 

One day you’ll look back on this turmoil and remember how you stood up and be grateful you did because it’ll have all been worth it and you’ll be in a better place.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been struggling with a lot of depressive and self-destructive thoughts for years now from what I can remember, it's not really mild and just a sad episode it's genuine feelings of emptiness and just wanting to close my eyes and never have to wake up again to any of this.  
I'm extremely paranoid about my friends, I feel like they all hate me and force themselves to be with me or to talk to me because otherwise, they think I'll hurt or kill myself.

Nothing feels genuine because I don't think anyone would ever want to hang out with me because of me or find me nice as a friend. Mostly because most of my childhood was of my friends treating me that way and I've never made a good experience of having a genuine friend who's just a friend.

And that makes me feel so alone and so unwanted, I'm so so scared everyone just sees me as a psychotic person they need to endure with or else they'd feel guilty over my suicide.   
I'm scared of opening up about my past trauma, I barely can trust anyone because of this.  
I want to hang myself in a local-giant forest before my 18th birthday, mainly because I want to be with dad for his birthday before I kill myself. I love him a lot but he also sees me as psychotic rather than a normal person, I know this from past conversations and the way he talks about my problems at the psychologist. My mom has abused me and I don't want to talk about that but I felt like I should mention it.

Nothing in my future seems good or just worth going through this pain, I'm at a loss what to do and I just want to hang myself. I've been crying since I woke up because my closest friends betrayed my trust yesterday and called the police on me because I was having a psychotic breakdown and talking about dying but I never said I'd try anything. 

They just called it because they didn't want to talk to me and didn't want to feel responsible for my death, that's what I think at least, am I selfish for thinking that?  
I'm just so heartbroken and shook up, none of them messaged me since yesterday either so I just feel like they truly hate me and have abandoned me. I feel like it's all my fault too that I broke our friendship and I lost one of the few things that still cheered my day up.

,SuicideWatch,"I [17, F] have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve had 2 suicide attempts just this year, have been in a psych ward once and have been on meds since September of this year.

It’s been going fairly well, I even got to a point where I had no suicidal thoughts for a few weeks straight, but now it’s all coming back.

To give you some context, these past few months have been rough for me. Currently, I am unemployed and have been struggling to find a job for weeks now. I don't have a car so my choices are incredibly limited. What I'm doing wrong I don't know. My strongest guess is that my Aspergers is to blame. I say things I don't mean or I just completely twist my wording. It's always been incredibly annoying and I hate it.

I still have money in the bank but it's slowly shrinking by the day. It won't last long and I'm still struggling for a job. I feel like an absolute loser because of this. I'm only 19 but already I've fucked up bad in life and don't have much money to my name. 

The other thing that has me being weighed down is my dream to be a writer. For you see, since sophomore year of high school I had been creating a science fantasy universe of my own creation. Several years I've worked on this and I want to see my dream of it blossom become true. Yet no matter how hard I try, no matter what method I use...I can't get anyone to even bother giving my work a chance. It always feels like I'm just fucking terrible or that I'm cursed. Like some entity I cannot see is torturing me by ruining my chances at any breakthrough, beating me down with terrible luck. I've invested in so much money towards concept art and everything and yet still nothing. It's like I'm screaming but I don't realize I'm buried 6 feet into the earth. That or no one will bother to listen to me because my stuff is that utterly terrible so I don't even deserve to be acknowledged. 

All this together has put me into a deep depression that I've hidden away from everybody so they wouldn't worry.

After I try pain, if pain doesn't stop me.... I'm 100% ready to die,  I am doing the full arsenal. Everything in my power to die. If I do not or cannot die, then I will live 110% of every piece of life. If only I did not have to be alone.. God, help me.

Better than beauty, then each breath I take, with someone, a witness to my life as I wanted to be to theirs.. Better than whatever this is. In this chair, useless as fuck and unloved forever... It'll be new and maybe better, and maybe not. But what's my crime? People, what's my reason God forgot  me? What's the reason life *hurts* in here. In HERE [my chest, my body?

,SuicideWatch,"So yesterday I was going through chat messages I had with one of my friends and came across a photo that reminded me of a horrible thing that I did years ago. Thing that I wish never happened. Photo was taken on a last high school trip we had. We were staying at a hotel. One evening me and one of my friends were walking down a hallway and noticed that the doors of one hotel room were open. It was a room where two of our female classmates were staying. We got inside of the room and noticed that one of our female classmates was sleeping on the bed tucked in blanket. For whatever reason we thought it would be funny if each of us got on bed and the other took a photo of it. So I got on bed, lay beside her and awkwardly put my arm across her and my friend took a photo after wich I got up and took a photo of my friend doing the same thing. We didn't sexually grab her, touch her nor did we intend to do anything like that. We just thought it would be a funny photo. Which it wasn't at all.

So yesterday I came across this photo and didn't find it funny at all. It was creppy and inappropriate behaviour and I felt really awful about doing this. I have no idea what me or my friend were thinking at the time. I guess we thought it would be some kind of a funny prank. Looking back at it it was completely inappropriate and ever since I saw the photo I have felt this terrible burden and shame because of what we did. I fell too much shame to really talk to anybody about this so I wanted to confesse here. Guilt that I feel has really paralyzed me for the past couple of days.  It’s all I can think about.

I would really like to apologize to her but Im not sure how. I cant remeber if we ever showed her the photo and it would probably make her feel really uncomfortable if I brought it up to her now.

,SuicideWatch,"   Hello... so starting off... I really don’t like complaining to people so I usually just keep these thoughts written in my notes so I apologize if I’m being annoying. The two times I tried to reach out online, I was ignored and it didn’t really make me ever want to reach out again, but I’m desperate. 

   So... I’m 15 and I have autism. Ever since I was young, my mother never really seemed to care about when I was overstimulated so she just yelled at me to stop. As I got older, even after getting diagnosed, she’s still telling me that I am overreacting and it hurts. That’s when she got me a weighted blanket. When I first got it, I was super happy, but when I look back on it, I think she just bought it thinking that she wouldn’t have to deal with me overstimulating because of this “shield” thing. It makes me feel like she doesn’t actually care. 

  Now onto school. All throughout my life, all my friends have left me because of the way I am. I’m repetitive and loud and not understanding of social cues which is not something most people really like. Thankfully, I met my current friends who don’t care about that stuff... but they seem to be drifting away. They both are in band so they both have to do PE at lunch which leaves me sitting alone most of the time. As an introvert and an aspie, I’m fine with being alone. The problem occurs when they come back from PE. They never talk to me and they’re always talking to each other. It’s like I’m not even there sometimes and it hurts.

    And then... my boyfriend who just broke up with me. I really liked him and he seemed to be a good match with me. But... due to the fact that I would sometimes go to him for emotional support, he left me. I know that I was drowning him in my emotions and I wish I didn’t because now I will never see him again (He goes to another school and I can’t drive).

    The reason why I want to commit suicide is because I have nothing else to live for. I can’t live for my mother as she doesn’t even really care. I can’t live for my friends because they’re off on their own living their own lives. I can’t depend on my ex because... well he’s an ex. And I sure as hell can’t live for myself. It’s hard to explain (Because it has to do with autism), but I just can’t do this anymore. If I left, no one would care and they’d all forget about me.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm a 21 years old guy, soon 22. I never had a girlfriend, and I'm still virgin.  Not just I was never able to get a girlfriend, but I was also never able to find hookups or one night stands (don't misunderstand me, I'm not looking only for sex from women).  I have been trying dating since I was around 15-16 years old, to no avail.

It hurts me everyday to think about the fact that almost every guy and girl had a crush/love/relationship in high school, but I did not. In high school, all my male friends had at least one girl who was having a crush on them. But I was never interesting for girls. According to my girl friends, I'm good looking and I have a very great sense of humor. I also have a lot of interests and hobbies, so I'm not a boring person. 

I've been using Tinder for more than a year now, and even though I was able to get matches, they either never replied back to my message, or they unmatched with me even without talking. There was about 5 girls who I was able to talk with for a longer time from Tinder, but whenever I asked them out on a date, they would say ""you are a good friend but you are not my type"" or ""let's just stay friends"". I also had a couple of women who just played with me, and used me for my kindness, like they made me believe how deeply in love with me they are, and then when I tell them the same, they would laugh and backstab me. I asked advice from my friends, and they told me I should go out with them clubbing, and talk to girls there. I tried it, but there are 2 problems with this: 1.I have absolutely no idea on how to start a conversation with a girl who is a complete stranger to me IRL (even though on Tinder, I have pretty good starting lines). And 2: it's always my friends who get the girls while clubbing, because the girls are interested in them, but not in me. I have no idea how they do it, I'm not a silent loner or anything like that.

My condition is getting worse day by day, I'm thinking about suicide more often. I am already self harming, and I feel very bad for it because I made myself some very bad scars which I have to hide, and think of fake explanations for them when someone notices them.  For the past month, I even started hating women, which I know is not right and is a very bad thing, but the rage and loneliness and disappointment makes me sick every day, every night I have difficulties falling asleep because of all the rage and feeling of desperation.  Also, I now rarely go out (except when I go to work) because whenever I see a loving couple or a pretty girl walking on the street, I immediately feel anger and depression, because I know I might never experience these things such as love and relationship.

I know, now many of you will say ""you are just 21, life is just ahead of you"" or ""things will get better just wait"" , but I highly doubt it. It feels worse than death, just to think about we all have one lives, and other people were able to find love and date in high school, and here I am at the age of 21, being virgin, and being late for such things as ""high school love"".  

&amp;#x200B;

,SuicideWatch,"Just something that I have been thinking about a lot lately... 

I feel like all anyone cares about when someone hints/talks about suicide is how the act might hurt everyone else in their life. For example, everyone always tells you that you ""have no idea how much that will hurt your family, friends, loved ones blah blah blah"". While I completely understand how losing a loved one to suicide could be a traumatic experience, I feel like nobody seems to be able to sympathize with the victim and understand that this is what they wanted and was actually for the best.

I have no joy in life at all. I literally wake up every morning and dread the day ahead. I am unemployed, alone and just over life in general. I have lost the will to continue fighting for something that has never made me happy, even in the best of times. I don't feel like I should have to continue living just to appease everyone else in my life. However, if I hint at not wanting to do this anymore then I immediately get the guilt trip from anyone in my life. 

I feel like people just don't want to deal with the inconvenience of losing a loved one and having to deal with the aftermath. Why are they unable to see things from the viewpoint of the victim and realize that they were finally able to relieve the constant pain they are in? Is that not a very selfish way of viewing the entire situation?

I also feel like this stigma surrounding suicide perpetuates the problem because people are unwilling to say anything for fear of the guilt trip and judgement that comes along with saying the dreaded suicide word out loud. Idk, maybe I can't see things clearly because of the dark state that I am in right now. Does anyone feel this same way or understand what I am saying?",t2_5j1p2t1b,False,,0,False,Are the survivors of suicide the selfish ones?,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_eu19uk,False,dark,,public,3,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1580037271.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just something that I have been thinking about a lot lately... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like all anyone cares about when someone hints/talks about suicide is how the act might hurt everyone else in their life. For example, everyone always tells you that you &amp;quot;have no idea how much that will hurt your family, friends, loved ones blah blah blah&amp;quot;. While I completely understand how losing a loved one to suicide could be a traumatic experience, I feel like nobody seems to be able to sympathize with the victim and understand that this is what they wanted and was actually for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no joy in life at all. I literally wake up every morning and dread the day ahead. I am unemployed, alone and just over life in general. I have lost the will to continue fighting for something that has never made me happy, even in the best of times. I don&amp;#39;t feel like I should have to continue living just to appease everyone else in my life. However, if I hint at not wanting to do this anymore then I immediately get the guilt trip from anyone in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like people just don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the inconvenience of losing a loved one and having to deal with the aftermath. Why are they unable to see things from the viewpoint of the victim and realize that they were finally able to relieve the constant pain they are in? Is that not a very selfish way of viewing the entire situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel like this stigma surrounding suicide perpetuates the problem because people are unwilling to say anything for fear of the guilt trip and judgement that comes along with saying the dreaded suicide word out loud. Idk, maybe I can&amp;#39;t see things clearly because of the dark state that I am in right now. Does anyone feel this same way or understand what I am saying?&lt;/p&gt;

After being an asshole, especially when I was drinking, my now ex finally left me without any warning or communication to let me know how she was feeling and what she wanted (I know that I should have already known that I was being a fucking asshole but I can't change the past). The next day I started my new job as a ""chemical engineering co-op"" at a large chemical company and I feel like I don't know shit compared to anyone there including any of the other co-ops.

By far the worst part for me is that after some talking to my ex, she was willing to listen to what I had to say about me wanting to be better now that I knew there was a problem and said that she was willing to give it a try but it was going to be a slow process because she wanted to be sure that what I was saying was actually going to happen.

I’ve got acne and a greasy face, because I have shit hygiene, because I just couldn’t be fucked to try. I’ve got a fat nose, tiny lips and a big forehead. I have stretch marks all over and my teeth are bad. I’m really rude, easily stressed and confused, lazy, and have no plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life isn’t terrible because I’m depressed and suicidal. I’m depressed and suicidal because my life is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

From the outside our lives look great. Most of the time on the inside things are good too. There are just various issues that effect me that have become too much to bear at times. 

Sexually most of the time I don’t have a say over what happens to my body. On the off week every other month that he feels bad about what goes on between us I get to express myself sexually and things are good we end up succumbing to his desires. Even if for a week things are good he will inevitably take from me what I am not giving to him. I don’t have a choice if I say no life will at some point in the next 24 hrs be complete hell for me. Like I’ll be even more suicidal than if I just let him have his way. This sounds really bad as I write it. But this is not everyday just what happens sometimes.

I also never get time to myself other than when my 3 kids (8,4,1) are sleeping. My mom and MIL are both the kinds of grandparents that buy presents for the kids and go on their merry way. My husband will mot to give me any sort of break unless it’s on his terms. I’m still responsible for anything that the kids need like diaper changes, snacks etc. basically anything he doesn’t want to take care of.

This feels nice but it doesn’t result in me getting any of the things I need. #2 him telling me that I have nothing to complain about I don’t have a boss or go to work. That I can take a break whenever I want. Meanwhile he has just watched me work constantly and every time I sit down someone including him needs something. I’m pretty much not allowed to need anything and just do my job as a wife and mom and shut up. 

I’ve gone back work multiple times but it didn’t work out financially with childcare and it hurt the quality of my kids life.

,SuicideWatch,"I distinctly remember when I first began to have suicidal thoughts. I was 9 and I told my mom I didn’t want to live anymore. She fucking freakkkked out and was crying, which is understandable. She took me to see a psychiatrist, which is also understandable. I cried and cried and cried and begged her not to make me go, but I had no choice.

Looking back, I realize that was probably one of the most significant moments of my life. I had the ability to be completely open with people until then, as I was an innocent child. It was that experience that made me start bottling things up. I don’t tell anyone - especially my mom - a single bad thought or experience that I have. 

When that shit all went down at 9, I clearly remember feeling like I was being punished and she didn’t love me anymore. In reality, the exact opposite was true, but I was too young. It was traumatic for me and it fucked me up.

So, fast forward and I’m 29. I’ve accomplished a lot, although not nearly everything I want, and on paper, I should be happy as hell. But, I’m not at all. After the experience at 9, my life became a show. I buried any negative aspect and became a perfectionist, always trying to make my parents proud of me. I wanted them to love me and that’s what I felt I had to do to get that. 

Logically, I know they are proud of me. But I am so fucking empty. Just hollow. My entire existence is a facade, and I feel like such a fucking ungrateful person to be saying that. Truth is thought, I cannot help how I feel. I think I’m even more fucked up than I give myself credit for because I’ve never been able to attract a woman into my life who I could keep around. I’ve dated here and there, but it’s like something is off with me and I end up losing them, every time. It’s weird, I feel like I’m numb to that pain now, yet I know it plays into me wanting to kill myself. 

Despite having friends and a good job, I am really, really fucking lonely. 

And the feelings seem to get deeper as I age. It hurts more, but the pain is different. It feels more and more like resignation. Like I know I am done with this life. Perhaps the issues are too embedded in the fabric of who I am. This all originated when I was so young, and that was more than 20 years ago. 

On paper, I shouldn’t feel like this. Thing is, we don’t live on paper.

It's been a wild 26 years but I think this is finally it for me. At the current moment I'm 26 with no completed education past high-school. I'm currently unemployed after a string of grocery store jobs. And I'm 18k in debt. I'm engaged to the greatest girl in the world, and I want to die.

I've suffered with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder for as long as I can remember. I can't even remember a time when I wasn't depressed anymore. Without going into my entire life story, my mentality started falling apart on a grand scale about 7 years ago. That's when the suicide attempts and the medication started.

Since then I've been alive, but definitely not living. The only thing I currently have going for me is my engagement. Unfortunately it's an international engagement and our K1 Visa is taking incredibly long to process. I spent the last 5 months living with her, trying to find the good in the world. And I did. She's the good in the world.

Unfortunately, four days from now I have to go back. I can't legally stay here any more. When I go back, I'll be going back to all of my problems. I'll be alone.

18k might not be a lot to some people, but for me, it's more money than I'll see in the next few years and it's enjoy to completely destroy my life. In fact, the first suicide attempt was because I was $2,000 in debt.

I've discussed this in depth with my fiancée and I've decided to keep this from her until it's time. I'm positive she'll be better off in 10 years without me. She knows I'm depressed, and have attempted suicide before, but I don't want her worrying, or blaming herself. No matter what I do, she'll worry and blame herself though. 

So, four days. When I go back, I'll have all the time and space I need to do it. I have a plan, I ordered my tool off of Amazon already, and now I guess I'm just trying to get it off my chest.

I will give a brief summary of the major stressors in my life and, maybe, I’ll find some advice from you lovely Redditors.

1. I have had an eating disorder for 17 years. I am currently 30. I have been hospitalized and forced into residential treatment numerous times. Treatment is a sham as it is primarily force-feeding while the underlying psychological issues are ignored. During my most recent admission I tried to commit suicide and was given electro-convulsive therapy as a final resort — because of this I have lost almost all the memories I had of the years 2011 through to 2017. I fight myself every day. My mind is a battlefield. I hate everything about who I am. I don’t have any expectations of ever recovering because food and appearance have always been an integral part of my life.

2. My relationship is suffering. I know I am not without guilt in why my fiancé and I are fighting, it takes two to tango. But I’m having such a hard time moving past things he has done. Because I love him so much, I feel as if I’m being torn in two. The cheating, the talking to women online, the temper, suddenly being physical with me. . . It’s difficult. We have a young baby too. I just feel like such garbage, like I have no worth.

3. Intense depression and other physical ailments.

4. Death of my father.

5. Go-nowhere jobs, despite being college educated.

6. The struggles of being a new mother, the fears of what I may/may not be doing for my child.

7. Money

Meanwhile it is infinitely easier for a woman to find companionship. I have spent 2 years completely isolated and I am near breaking point, and everywhere i look my notions get reinforced. I am ultimately, a useless, nameless and faceless cog in a city that does not give a single fuck about me.

And they never will. Cause I was born with a certain appearance, and a Y chromosome so I will have to deal with long drawn out periods of years and years of complete isolation. What the fuck is the point of continuing on?

I am a conventionally unattractive male in his 20s. I am esentially, &amp;#39;useless&amp;#39; in the eyes of my peers socially and romantically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys like me have one purpose, to pay taxes and fuck off and die. Every gf I ever had shunned me for showing an ounce of vulnerability, cause all it takes is a single swipe on tinder to find a more stable guy. And trust me, i fucking struggle to get even an ounce of attention as a male. I have to spend weeks, months, years to find a single person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile it is infinitely easier for a woman to find companionship. I have spent 2 years completely isolated and I am near breaking point, and everywhere i look my notions get reinforced. I am ultimately, a useless, nameless and faceless cog in a city that does not give a single fuck about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they never will. Cause I was born with a certain appearance, and a Y chromosome so I will have to deal with long drawn out periods of years and years of complete isolation. What the fuck is the point of continuing on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to stop living, I want to not exist anymore when I know I am not wanted by my peers. It is a difficult existence feeling like quasi-modo everywhere you go.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"There is a pretty tall and well-known bridge for ctb near my city. I've never been there but have read countless articles about it and the people living nearby, so naturally I just wanted to have a peak. Just looking at the bridge cause, you know, it might be interesting?

I don't know what I would've done when arriving there. It takes about 1 hour with the bus and train to get there and the whole time I was super nervous. Social anxiety makes public transport pretty hard, so I was already a mess after arriving at the central station, 20 minutes after leaving my house. I waited a while for my final train, stepped in and just got so sick, I almost threw up. I was shivering, sweating like crazy and feeling stared at. Got out, after one stop and it instantly faded away. Got a coffee and waited 10 minutes for the next train to the bridge. 

The same happened again and I just couldn't drive more than 1 station. In the end I took another train to the centre, visiting a psychiatric hospital I've been at for 10+ months last year and met some people there. I've noticed that talking to one or two nice people can be very reassuring and calming and how isolated I am socially. 

You know this feeling of just wishing someone would ask how you are? I wandered arround a city park, known for violence and drugs. I was hoping to get picked up by the police to get incarcerated in a ward or being stabbed to death by a mugger, or being run over by a car and so on.

Lets be honest, I would have done something stupid at the bridge. Either I would've climbed up a dangerous part despite my fear of heights or the stress would've killed me and there would be attempts of jumping. 

It feels like I have every mental problem there is. I kid you not, I have like 12 diagnoses and while I don't look like it I'm severely handicapped. Patients within the hospital always used to ask me for help, due to looking 'healthy' and more like a nurse than a patient. It's just not worth it anymore but at least the 'I-could-just-end-it-another-day-lets-see-what-happens'-way of thinking helps a bit.

Still, I'll be thinking about the bridge again very soon. It's always about ctb and the guilt I'm feelling; I've seen the devastating effects of suicides within families and it eats me up.

,SuicideWatch,"almost every single day now honestly ?? I don’t even know what to say or even where to start, it’s past 3am and I guess this is a bit of a vent that I need after crying a whole lot. life was honestly going okay towards the end of 2019 - even really great at times which was wild to me because I had spent two entire years prior to that feeling so incredibly depressed and suicidal constantly.

But the very end of December and now this month has just been....... rough. In every aspect. So so rough. I mean some of the stuff that has been rough this month has been happening since October-ish, like my health slowly decreasing for seemingly no reason at all. But back then I could handle it. One health problem / illness didn’t really shake my world you know ? But since it’s just been one thing after another on a constant cycle with /maybe/ a couple weeks between..... i literally can’t even remember what it feels like to feel like myself again. It’s excruciatingly exhausting .... and completely lonely

I’ve been so happy being alone the past few months. But now I just feel lonely in every sense of the word. In like every aspect. For many reasons which I won’t get into. I can kind of feel myself slipping back into spiral of deep depression instead of just the unhappiness I’d feel sometimes if something was bad in my life. and then the suicidal ideation and thoughts kick in, but now unlike before, it’s more of a logical reasoning??? Whereas before it was always emotional for me. I’m just not scared anymore. I’m not afraid of dying anymore. I really feel so empty. Nothing I did during those good months seems to really kick these feelings, which are becoming more and more frequent. And I guess the fact that I am no longer scared or afraid, and the fact suicide logically seems like the correct route for me right now, is what’s scaring me ??

Honestly I really don’t know the point of this post, I just needed somewhere to vent to where no one I actually know could see it. I just want to feel less alone. I just want to know someone understands at least how lonely I’m feeling, and how being suicidal feels. (Especially feeling it again after a while of not feeling that way, and how THAT makes you feel.) Sending love to you all",t2_ktt7x2a,False,,0,False,suicidal thoughts have been creeping in again recently for the first time in many months,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_eu16zz,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580036887.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;almost every single day now honestly ?? I don’t even know what to say or even where to start, it’s past 3am and I guess this is a bit of a vent that I need after crying a whole lot. life was honestly going okay towards the end of 2019 - even really great at times which was wild to me because I had spent two entire years prior to that feeling so incredibly depressed and suicidal constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the very end of December and now this month has just been....... rough. In every aspect. So so rough. I mean some of the stuff that has been rough this month has been happening since October-ish, like my health slowly decreasing for seemingly no reason at all. But back then I could handle it. One health problem / illness didn’t really shake my world you know ? But since it’s just been one thing after another on a constant cycle with /maybe/ a couple weeks between..... i literally can’t even remember what it feels like to feel like myself again. It’s excruciatingly exhausting .... and completely lonely&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been so happy being alone the past few months. But now I just feel lonely in every sense of the word. In like every aspect. For many reasons which I won’t get into. I can kind of feel myself slipping back into spiral of deep depression instead of just the unhappiness I’d feel sometimes if something was bad in my life. and then the suicidal ideation and thoughts kick in, but now unlike before, it’s more of a logical reasoning??? Whereas before it was always emotional for me. I’m just not scared anymore. I’m not afraid of dying anymore. I really feel so empty. Nothing I did during those good months seems to really kick these feelings, which are becoming more and more frequent. And I guess the fact that I am no longer scared or afraid, and the fact suicide logically seems like the correct route for me right now, is what’s scaring me ??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I really don’t know the point of this post, I just needed somewhere to vent to where no one I actually know could see it. I just want to feel less alone. I just want to know someone understands at least how lonely I’m feeling, and how being suicidal feels. (Especially feeling it again after a while of not feeling that way, and how THAT makes you feel.) Sending love to you all&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Tw: possible assault 


Three years ago, I hooked up with someone. A few days later, they told me they felt uncomfortable because they were drunk. I feel like I assaulted this person, and I genuinely don’t think I deserve to be alive because of it. The person didn’t seem drunk - I knew they had been drinking at an event prior to us hanging out but they in no way seemed drunk or impaired. Describing that is in no way to victim blame or put this on them, just to give more context. I offered to report this with the person when they told me they felt uncomfortable, but they said I was overreacting and that our time together had just come to an end.
This was three years ago, and it’s been all-consuming ever since. I’ve been going to therapy, but it is not helping. I don’t want to die - I want to live a fulfilled life, have a family, start a career, but I’m putting that all off to spare this person from ever having to see me in the public light. I have this immense fear that they are going to reevaluate the situation down the road and realize they were negatively affected by it. I can’t ever do anything I’ve had dreams of doing - making music, starting my own company, etc. I am at rock bottom. I’m exhausted. I’ve been in bed all day, and the thought of having to get up for work on Tuesday (I’m on a staycation) is killing me. I don’t want to die, I just feel like I deserve to. I feel like this is the one unforgivable mistake - everyone says your mistakes don’t define you but I feel like this lapse in judgement has cost me my entire life. I’m only 22. I’m scared, because the stigma around this kind of stuff (understandably so) is so harsh and there isn’t any room for forgiveness or making amends. I did not intentionally seek out to harm this person, and I wish I would have never went over to their fucking place. I haven’t hooked up with anyone in over 2 years.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been suicidal for 11 years, since I was 11. Nothing seems to change it, I can be so happy or so low and there's still this unrelenting urge that tells me to die. I've attempted a fair few times with no success and the only thing that discourages me from other attempts is the fear of failing again and having to go through the entire process of getting told off for trying to die.

I've reached out to friends, made posts on my social media to the people I know. It all outlines how I've felt this way for years, how my anxiety works me up, how my depression keeps me low, I often get manic too, sometimes I'm not even aware of what I'm doing it's like I'll be watching myself harm my body as if I was watching a show on tv, it's all happening and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

I feel like just the smallest things will push me over the edge some days and other days I'll hold it all in until it builds up and I can't handle anything anymore.

I'm currently with a job, in a relationship, I live at home since I can't afford rent where I am since it's a commuter town. But I'm not in the worst situation. If anything I just feel ignored. When I feel bad I tell people but it often feels like no ones listening and when they do it's too late and I'll be in hysterics and attempting to take my life. The mental health services do nothing to help, I was told I was fine 3 weeks after trying to jump off a rail bridge (a passer by pulled me down off it). I've had to go to private therapists only to be told that I can't be helped, I've been tried and tested with CBT and mindfulness several times by different people and it just doesn't seem to work for me. I'm also told every time I have to work hard to get better, but I do work hard, I work really hard but to me it seems like no one else puts in the work. For years I've never been invited to things I always have to ask other people if they want to do stuff, I looked after myself as a child because I was honestly just tired of being criticised for not being good enough for my parents and even now at my age they still don't fully respect me.

I know it sounds very bad and I'm trying to blame other people but it's not that, I think there's something very wrong with my brain but I just sort of wish people put more effort in to help, I wish they showed more concern for me and I wish they knew when I get down it often is for no reason, some days there are triggers but so often I'll feel terrible with no real explanation as to why I feel that way. I do try very hard to help others when they're in need, sometimes even for my own benefit as helping them with their issues distracts me from my own, but there feels like there's and imbalance, I thought most relationships were give take but I just keep having people take from me. There are a few people who really do give and give but I feel bad leaning on them all the time. I hate that professionals who are supposed to be qualified to help me keep shrugging me off, it's not the responsibility of a few good mates to try and help me deal with my mental health issues, that's really not fair on them.

Obvious throwaway.  
Not attention seeking but more seeking advice....

All I have been thinking about the past 2 weeks.  
I'm currently 16.  
I'm very introverted and shy with almost no social skills. I stay away from everyone. Getting bullied all the time.  
That's why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC's being an escape from that.  
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.  
On top of that I have realized I'm 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I've never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?  
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.  
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?  
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.  
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.  
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.  
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.  
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?  
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.  
But im losing hope every day more and more.

I laid in bed, day and night crying. I was alone with my thoughts. I turned to music. I would daydream and imagine me somewhere else doing amazing things. But now it’s gotten to where all I do is daydream. When I mean all day...it’s all day. Its consumed my life for the past FIVE years! I don’t know how to stop because I have a lot of time on my hands since  I don’t have a job. I’ve applied to many places and I‘ve heard nothing back. 

It’s so stressful, I need to pay bills and my money is dwindling quickly. It’s difficult to get out of this rut because I haven’t worked in awhile and socialized with people. I just stay in my room and be on my phone.
I don’t go out much, which makes me scared of the world or try anything new. I need to get out of my comfort zone. I’m already 22. That may seem young, but not to me.

I just feel numb. I have to literally force myself to smile and laugh when I’m out with people. Which scares me. 
I do take medicine. I’m on four different pills and see my psychologist. But nothing is helping.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I'm not asking anyone to read any of this or even comment anything. I'm sorry anyway. I don't even know why I'm doing this. 

I've been depressed for so long. Only this year did I get help. Couldn't open up to the doctor about constant suicidal feelings and urges to self harm so they prescribed me prozac 20mg. After being this close to killing myself they raised the dose to prozac 40mg. They can't prescribe different meds until I try the higher dose. The meds don't fucking work.

I have been so fucking lonely for so long. I am in constant fear of being abandoned. I crave genuine connections but why tf would anyone want to form one with me. I am always scared people I care for will leave me. I am so touch starved. This girl seemed interested in me and texted me first, which has never happened ever. I was thinking about her constantly and already thinking about laying down my life for this person. I almost immediately descended into a deeper spiral of depression, constant urge to self harm. I just want to dig a fucking blade in me and let the blood run out. I realised I don't have actual feelings for this person, I just wanted someone to temporarily get rid of my loneliness. I dont have feelings at all. There's literally nothing inside me except misery. 

I can't see myself making it through this year. Or this month. I wish I lived in the USA so I could get a gun and blow my fucking brains out. I wish I never wake up so I don't have to deal with tomorrow and endure this messed up life

I have let everyone down. I wasted potential.

I feel like an attention grabbing selfish fuck. I was never abused as a child. I have been very lucky in many ways. And yet I am constantly wishing I have a heart attack or aneurysm and just drop dead. How can i say I feel like this when people have lived incredibly difficult lives? I am deceiving my ""friends"" by hiding my depression behind a stupid fake personality. I don't even know what my acual personality is as I've been depressed for so long it is just me.

No energy. Just lying on the floor and crying uncontrollably. Or sitting around feeling nothing. It would be so much better if I was dead. I keep thinking if I'm gonna kill myself, I'll kill myself tonight. But it never happens, im such a coward. There is no way out, i ruined my chances and I'll spend the rest of my life working minimum wage because i cant study.

I've been self harming for years and have had suicidal thoughts since the age of 9/10. I just wish I wasn't born. Someone please just come and shoot me. I can't make it to tomorrow. I don't want to even try. That makes me sound like such a stupid pussy

why am i even bothering to write this

If I don't kill myself sometime this year I will definitely do it as soon as my mum dies

And yet I am constantly wishing I have a heart attack or aneurysm and just drop dead. How can i say I feel like this when people have lived incredibly difficult lives? I am deceiving my &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; by hiding my depression behind a stupid fake personality. I don&amp;#39;t even know what my acual personality is as I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for so long it is just me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No energy. Just lying on the floor and crying uncontrollably. Or sitting around feeling nothing. It would be so much better if I was dead. I keep thinking if I&amp;#39;m gonna kill myself, I&amp;#39;ll kill myself tonight. But it never happens, im such a coward. There is no way out, i ruined my chances and I&amp;#39;ll spend the rest of my life working minimum wage because i cant study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been self harming for years and have had suicidal thoughts since the age of 9/10. I just wish I wasn&amp;#39;t born. Someone please just come and shoot me. I can&amp;#39;t make it to tomorrow. I don&amp;#39;t want to even try. That makes me sound like such a stupid pussy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;why am i even bothering to write this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#39;t kill myself sometime this year I will definitely do it as soon as my mum dies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I alive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing to offer people. I&amp;#39;m boring and socially anxious and I have nothing interesting to add. Just a fucking creep. People will be glad when I&amp;#39;m gone. I&amp;#39;m not going to try anymore as I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be around much longer. Whats the point&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I want to commit suicide. There is no question about it. The only reason for hesitation is that I don't want to hurt the people who I love. I've been suicidal for the vast majority of my life, including childhood. It doesn't feel like an easier feeling to deal with as time goes on. It primarily gets harder.

But I'm in a city with no friends and a SO who is usually busy. I feel completely and utterly alone. I don't know if I have ever felt this horrible in my life. I've been suicidal for most of it, but now I am seriously at the end of my rope.

I want to talk about it with my therapist, but I can't handle the trauma of being hospitalized for the 6th time. I know that if I was completely honest, I would undoubtedly be locked up. The 5th time was primarily dissociation and flashbacks, so I honestly think it would do more harm than good.

Oh, and I have officially failed at my career goals and had to give that up. So that's cool. I'm too dysfunctional to handle that career path. Now I'm too dysfunctional to handle basic tasks. I can't pretend I feel okay about it. Even eating is challenging.

It also hurts a bit to know that the only time my parents are capable of showing me genuine compassion is when I'm in crisis. I don't know whether it feels good or bad honestly. It feels good to have my abusive parents care about me, but it hurts that me hardcore wanting to be dead is the one and only time they show compassion.

I can't find joy in anything. I try getting out. I try doing activities I used to enjoy. I'd rather do nothing and feel terrible than do something that should be enjoyable and feel even more terrible.

I'm certainly a danger to myself, but I WILL NOT let myself be hospitalized again. That would be more than I can bear and would likely only make things worse. Is there an alternate option that isn't super expensive?

Edit: Also I feel it is worth listing my diagnoses. The main two are Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder (mostly caused by abusive parents and then made worse by other abuse).

,SuicideWatch,"So... not quite sure how to start one of these. This is my first post on Reddit. I usually just lurk around subreddits without posting anything. Heck, I made this account just to make this post.

I should start by saying that I'm very aware of how lucky I am compared to a lot of people in the world. I don't have any family or bullying issues, and for the most part my life is pretty much the opposite of a struggle. I'm seriously grateful for all the support and love I've received from my family throughout my twenty-odd years of life. I get along with them great, and we all share the same wonky sense of humour. I still live with my parents and siblings (I'm the oldest). I even recently got my first part-time job and I would like to eventually move out into a nice small apartment somewhere. 

My friends used to say I was the funny one in the group. I remember in secondary school, my BFF was asked why she was friends with me and she said that I was the funniest person she knows. It's sad to say, but I'm definitely one of those people who ""peaked in highschool"". Although I wasn't one of the ""popular kids"", I was well known in my year group. Almost all of the teachers knew me by name, and I loved my conversations with them. I consistently won student awards, and my grades were pretty nice too. I was pretty good at sports and took part in any sports clubs I could. My group of friends was amazing. We did so much together. We were all different, and had totally different interests, but that's what made us work so well together. There was never a dull moment with that lot. 

I remember, things started to feel different in my last year of secondary school. I can't tell what changed, but all of a sudden my emotions didn't really feel quite right. I still laughed and smiled as usual, but it felt like I actually had to consciously put some effort in. I wouldn't say I felt sad. I'm not sure how I would describe it, but it's like I couldn't get too emotional about much of anything.

I started missing more school around then. I started going to clubs less too. Not sure why, but I just couldn't get motivated to go sometimes. It's weird, because I had my friends, and my teachers there. I liked the subjects I was studying, and I was still doing well grades-wise. Sometimes, I'd fake an illness to get out of going in for a couple of days here or there. A couple of times, I tripped over on purpose just to get out because of a ""sore ankle"" or something. That way, it didn't seem like I was sick all the time. I made sure not to be too absent though - didn't want people to start getting super worried about my health.

I finished secondary school with good grades and started college not long after. Everything seemed pretty cool up until I started my second year. Things were looking up. Almost all of my friends went to the same college, and I still kept in touch with the ones who didn't for a while. For some reason, I started getting sick for realsies, and quite often. I found that I couldn't concentrate properly. I found myself zoning out a lot. My friends and I didn't have as much of a chance to interact with eachother due to our timetables, and I found that I smiled less and less as the days went by. I got so sick and weak that I actually had to drop out of my second year of college and redo it a year later. Even after that, my concentration didn't seem to improve. As you would expect, my grades suffered. I couldn't really concentrate in the exams, but I managed to barely pass all of my A-Levels. When I received my results in the mail, I was just like, ""Huh, I see"". My parents seemed upset, but I just couldn't feel sad about it. I played it off with a smile. I was happy that I didn't fail.

I procrastinated when it came to my university application, and decided that I'd put it off for a year. A gap year sounded like a good idea. My parents agreed, so I became a NEET. I just stayed at home all day, playing the occasional videogame or reading books. I watched anime too. Every now and then I'd go out to the local park and sit on a bench or a swing and listen to music.

I lost touch with my friends. I already stopped using social media, so we usually kept in touch via text/calls. I started responding to them less and less. It got to the point where I actually lied to my best friend about having a job at the local mall, just so she wouldn't worry about me. Eventually we didn't talk at all. For the most part I feel it's for the best. I know it's really selfish, but I felt kinda useless and lazy, and I didn't want my friends to have to put up with me. 

A year had passed, and I still didn't really feel motivated to go back into education just yet. I decided to actually look for a job instead of sitting around, twiddling my thumbs. I signed up with the local job centre too, and got busy. Every job I applied for rejected me, and that's understandable given the current job market.

While searching for employment, I started a course that was supposed to boost my employability and soft skills. Through that course, I made a lot of new friends. We still keep in touch from time to time, but I can't help but feel like I'm dragging them down. I don't know why, but every time people start to depend on me, it kinda stresses me out. I get worried that I'm not as good as they think I am. What if they realise that I'm not as happy as I let on? What if they really get to know me properly and realise that they've wasted their time on me?

A few months ago I got my current job as a part time retail worker. The pay is minimum wage, but it's enough to help my parents out and pay for my hobbies. I get along pretty well with all of my co-workers. I hit all of my targets. I try to make sure the customers are as happy and comfortable as possible. I'd say I'm pretty good at my job for the most part. There are times when I really feel how strained my smiles are. I laugh along with my coworkers and customers, and I make sure I have a pleasant demeanor, but sometimes it feels like it takes just a bit too much effort. Sometimes I'll have a great sales day, and then I'll start worrying. What if they expect this level of performance from now on? I'm not sure if I can live up to those kinds of expectations sometimes.

A month ago, I finally applied for university. I'm pretty good with computers for the most part, and I'm good at maths, so I figured I'd apply for a computer science degree (with a foundation year as I've been out of education for a couple of years now). I had already been learning java in my spare time for a few months. I picked my five uni choices, and sent off my application. For the first time in a while I was actually kinda pleased with myself.

Yesterday morning I received two rejection emails. Honestly, I didn't even feel disappointed. It's strange, but I don't really feel that bad now either. I want to tell my parents, but honestly I don't want to see their reactions. I'm sure they will be disappointed in me. I should feel disappointed too, but I just feel empty.

I feel like lately there are two me's. There's the me that laughs and smiles and puts and effort into the things they do. Then there's the empty me that nobody sees. 

Sometimes when I'm alone I just lie down and do nothing at all. Sometimes I think about how I'm a waste of space and resources. Part of me is sure that my family thinks I'm a failure. I know I do. Im stuck. I feel like I'm walking, but I'm always in the same place no matter how fast I move my legs. No matter what I do, I can't change who I am as a person. I think about how easy it would be to die. My family might be sad for a while sure, but I'm sure they'd get over me eventually. On the plus side, I wouldn't be taking up so much space in our small house. I kinda feel guilty for being alive. I've had so many opportunities and I've let them all slip through my fingers. Opportunities that other people would've been so grateful for.",t2_5js73gxd,False,,0,False,I'm a waste,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,False,t3_evd7ev,False,dark,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1580280591.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So... not quite sure how to start one of these. This is my first post on Reddit. I usually just lurk around subreddits without posting anything. Heck, I made this account just to make this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should start by saying that I&amp;#39;m very aware of how lucky I am compared to a lot of people in the world. I don&amp;#39;t have any family or bullying issues, and for the most part my life is pretty much the opposite of a struggle. I&amp;#39;m seriously grateful for all the support and love I&amp;#39;ve received from my family throughout my twenty-odd years of life. I get along with them great, and we all share the same wonky sense of humour. I still live with my parents and siblings (I&amp;#39;m the oldest). I even recently got my first part-time job and I would like to eventually move out into a nice small apartment somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends used to say I was the funny one in the group. I remember in secondary school, my BFF was asked why she was friends with me and she said that I was the funniest person she knows. It&amp;#39;s sad to say, but I&amp;#39;m definitely one of those people who &amp;quot;peaked in highschool&amp;quot;. Although I wasn&amp;#39;t one of the &amp;quot;popular kids&amp;quot;, I was well known in my year group. Almost all of the teachers knew me by name, and I loved my conversations with them. I consistently won student awards, and my grades were pretty nice too. I was pretty good at sports and took part in any sports clubs I could. My group of friends was amazing. We did so much together. We were all different, and had totally different interests, but that&amp;#39;s what made us work so well together. There was never a dull moment with that lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember, things started to feel different in my last year of secondary school. I can&amp;#39;t tell what changed, but all of a sudden my emotions didn&amp;#39;t really feel quite right. I still laughed and smiled as usual, but it felt like I actually had to consciously put some effort in. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I felt sad. I&amp;#39;m not sure how I would describe it, but it&amp;#39;s like I couldn&amp;#39;t get too emotional about much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started missing more school around then. I started going to clubs less too. Not sure why, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t get motivated to go sometimes. It&amp;#39;s weird, because I had my friends, and my teachers there. I liked the subjects I was studying, and I was still doing well grades-wise. Sometimes, I&amp;#39;d fake an illness to get out of going in for a couple of days here or there. A couple of times, I tripped over on purpose just to get out because of a &amp;quot;sore ankle&amp;quot; or something. That way, it didn&amp;#39;t seem like I was sick all the time. I made sure not to be too absent though - didn&amp;#39;t want people to start getting super worried about my health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished secondary school with good grades and started college not long after. Everything seemed pretty cool up until I started my second year. Things were looking up. Almost all of my friends went to the same college, and I still kept in touch with the ones who didn&amp;#39;t for a while. For some reason, I started getting sick for realsies, and quite often. I found that I couldn&amp;#39;t concentrate properly. I found myself zoning out a lot. My friends and I didn&amp;#39;t have as much of a chance to interact with eachother due to our timetables, and I found that I smiled less and less as the days went by. I got so sick and weak that I actually had to drop out of my second year of college and redo it a year later. Even after that, my concentration didn&amp;#39;t seem to improve. As you would expect, my grades suffered. I couldn&amp;#39;t really concentrate in the exams, but I managed to barely pass all of my A-Levels. When I received my results in the mail, I was just like, &amp;quot;Huh, I see&amp;quot;. My parents seemed upset, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t feel sad about it. I played it off with a smile.

When 2019 came, I changed school, lost all my friends and was just in a bad phase, so i the ehen the first day of class ended, I tried to kill myself with my father's gun, so I loaded that shit, aimed to my face face I couldnt pull the trigger because my brother would be the one who would find my empty body and this was unfair with him.
After that day I tried to improve my life, study hard, go to the gym and this kind of stuff, but once my mother said that I would be better off dead and that her life would be better if I hadnt be born and because of that, I think of suicide 99% of my life.

,SuicideWatch,"First I sorry for bad English

In summer my girlfriend kill herself over real life issue and online issue. I was bothered and turn to alcohol and drug. I meet a very kind man who knew my girlfriend online who ran a few community my girlfriend had been part of who very much help me through that time. They devote a lot of time and energy in helping me recover.

The man who help me is good smart man who want to help people but I think people take advantage of that. Now he also hurting and I want to help but I am running out of idea.

I like to go over what happen so people can understand. Over month ago this man was apparently voted out of group running community he love and group then say very mean things about him in front of everyone. Man have had very rough year and has very difficult decision on life changing operation he not want to make. Being part of that group and community was very important for him.

After he recieve large amount of harassment telling him to kill himself that spread from online and effect real life. He now resign from job. He seem to keep getting worse.

He feel his friend don't care. They keep making promise they break. He say two of the people in charge of that community say they could still be part of group that important but gave up when newer people in group not want him around.

He feel no one care. His friend all betray him. That he forget who he is. That he have nothing left to smile for. All while face with very complicated medical decision and it bridging to other community and real life.

People who say they care and want to help say they feel lost. His wording and behavior even more worrying than my girlfriend was. Even people who were part of group and person who supposed to be in charge say they want to help but feel hands tied. He check most of boxes on guide in side bar of this subreddit.

&lt;p&gt;In summer my girlfriend kill herself over real life issue and online issue. I was bothered and turn to alcohol and drug. I meet a very kind man who knew my girlfriend online who ran a few community my girlfriend had been part of who very much help me through that time. They devote a lot of time and energy in helping me recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who help me is good smart man who want to help people but I think people take advantage of that. Now he also hurting and I want to help but I am running out of idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to go over what happen so people can understand. Over month ago this man was apparently voted out of group running community he love and group then say very mean things about him in front of everyone. Man have had very rough year and has very difficult decision on life changing operation he not want to make. Being part of that group and community was very important for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After he recieve large amount of harassment telling him to kill himself that spread from online and effect real life. He now resign from job. He seem to keep getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He feel his friend don&amp;#39;t care. They keep making promise they break. He say two of the people in charge of that community say they could still be part of group that important but gave up when newer people in group not want him around.

To sum up theses last few months, I am a 34 year old agoraphobic African American virgin, with 15 years in the United States Air Force dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts.  I came really close to attempting suicide after receiving my most recent assignment by going to a gun store with thought of shooting myself.  I quickly left the store and cried in a parking lot.  I called the suicide hotline and that quickly went South making me more depressed.  I thought about what was really making me unhappy and it was because the job I do just doesn't make me happy. 

After really thinking about my situation and talking to people on Reddit I got a link to the suicide chat-line. Which is perfect for a guy that has difficulty speaking and talking to people.  We came to the conclusion that I should just seperate use my GI bill to pursue what I love even if I don't get my military retirement at 38, I can work as a reservist and get my retirement much later.   What's the point of staying in the military for an early retirement if you don't live to see it?

Fast forward to now, I am currently in the process of seperating and I've never been happier. My superiors think I'm crazy but they don't know how close I came to killing myself. I tell them now that I'll give them all I have for the next few months but that's it....I'm ready to leave.

I’ll try to make this short. 22, male, go to Big Ten school. I’m successful, high grades, lots of friends, applying to medical school with a solid chance at going to a good program. I’ve never struggled with depression, no one knows how I feel.

I wouldn’t even say I’m depressed now. I’m happy, have energy, am doing well in most areas of life. I’m gay, and no one knows. I have a very accepting family and friend group, and I know I will be embraced. For some reason, I just don’t want to face it even though I know it will be okay.

I would rather just go away. I don’t necessarily want to die, but I don’t want to live my life. I want to drive a couple thousand miles and start a new life. But with today’s technology, that isn’t realistic. The other option is to die.

The worst part is I can’t tell anyone how I feel. Not a friend, not a mental health professional, not a counselor... because they WILL (no doubt) commit me to a psych ward. And I do NOT want to go. I have had friends go who have told me how terribles those places are.

,SuicideWatch,"Since I was in my teens, I started experiencing a lot of insecurities. Eventually in my 20's this started triggering a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. I am 24 now and since a couple years ago, I still feel anxiety, and I am pretty sure I have depression. I have never been diagnosed  because with college and my job, I do not have time to see a therapist. 

Anyways, I find myself constantly thinking about how worthless I am. I doubt every single thing I do. I am pessimistic about my future and my personality traits. I feel like the only person in my family that really loves me is my mother. I feel that I  am always the least favorite person in the room, and the person that no one  likes; not because I am an asshole, but simply because I do not have a likable personality. 

For the last year or year and a half, I started fantasizing about dying. I started thinking about how death would be the end of all my problems. No more dealing with people I do not like, poverty, stress, criticism, etc. Sometimes I think of ways I could make that happen. Now, I also ""know"" or think that killing myself is something I would never do. I know it is something I just fantasize about but I know I simply do not have the courage to do something like that out of fear of pain, fear of the unknown afterlife, and fear to hurt my mother. I also do have a tiny bit of hope that things will work out and that there is a possibility of happiness for me. However, the occasional thought of how killing myself would be like does cross my mind often. Again, at the moment, I know this is something I could never do. I won't kill myself at the moment, and I do not see myself doing it. 

My question is mainly for those that are seriously planning to commit suicide or that attempted to do it in the past. Did you start out this way? Thinking ""nah, that is something I would never do but it's interesting to think about it"" and then that curiosity grew until you actually did it? Am I suicidal?

I've been dragging people down with me for years. I'm a manipulator. I know my current friends wont admit it, maybe they having even noticed. It took so long for me to realize what I was doing. I'm such a horrible person and all I do is play the victim and antagonize everyone around me to make myself look better. I've lost so many fiends and I desperately cling to the few friends I do have. I'm so toxic and controlling. 

Things have been so horrible recently, I've been in the longest and worst depressive episode of my life. I almost attempted suicide on New Year's Eve, that was the closest I've come to doing it.

My mom said it's my fault that he was sick because the vet said the illness is mostly caused by stress. I didn't do anything to hurt him, my cat is one of my best friends, I feel so guilty and crushed. Maybe it is my fault. I take all the blame now, maybe I shouldn't.

The reason my grades are bad is because I'm depressed and fucking suicidal not because the doctor thinks I have ahdh. I want to get help but my parents think I'm just being dramatic.

&lt;p&gt;I also decided that my existence is pain and going on with it will only result in more pain. I don&amp;#39;t hate living for any particular reason, I just hate 95% of it. The 5% are alcohol and food. &lt;/p&gt;

I've come to think of myself as a dying cat,I'm still able to put on a healthy face for all those I'm close with and honestly been keeping it to myself for all except one,but I've stopped trying to make new friends or connections

I completely lack interest in living on,living inside this house,this body,it's hell for me

I constantly have to keep playing,listening to music,clicking buttons anything anything that won't let me alone with my thoughts because they always go back to how much I hate living

I've started not taking showers for days just because of how horrible I feel when I shower,not only do I have to come face to face with my own body but I can't keep the voices from coming

I learned that I can't ever count on anyone,I do mean it,I've always known that certain people wouldn't help me because they didn't want to,even if they said they love you,I never had a problem with that because I knew that wasn't true,I had way too much evidence pointing to the contrary,but a few days ago i realized even those who truly love me won't ever help either,not because they don't care,but because they can't 

I'm completely stranded,alone,haven't looked at a friendly face in months and given up on my dreams years ago

Only thing that has kept me alive up until now is how ineffective my methods have been,I'm really afraid of heights and asfixiation,not to mention I never wanted to make a mess,but I never had drugs available to me that were strong enough 

Until now

I don't think they're enough either,but they seem to be able to induce coma or death under the right conditions 

I'm honestly scared,i stole some of them from under my mom's nose while she wasn't looking,i feel like she knows it because when i checked the next time they weren't there

I'm afraid,afraid that they won't work

And I'm afraid that they will,I don't know why,but the thought terrifies me

I've had them safe and guarded in a place I'm sure no one will find

I feel like my last attempts were my emotions trumping logic,I was able to not kill myself but I couldn't take it,now it feels the opposite,I have nothing going for me,my life is a hellish standstill,I have begun to think of it as euthanasia

&lt;p&gt;I learned that I can&amp;#39;t ever count on anyone,I do mean it,I&amp;#39;ve always known that certain people wouldn&amp;#39;t help me because they didn&amp;#39;t want to,even if they said they love you,I never had a problem with that because I knew that wasn&amp;#39;t true,I had way too much evidence pointing to the contrary,but a few days ago i realized even those who truly love me won&amp;#39;t ever help either,not because they don&amp;#39;t care,but because they can&amp;#39;t &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m completely stranded,alone,haven&amp;#39;t looked at a friendly face in months and given up on my dreams years ago&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only thing that has kept me alive up until now is how ineffective my methods have been,I&amp;#39;m really afraid of heights and asfixiation,not to mention I never wanted to make a mess,but I never had drugs available to me that were strong enough &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re enough either,but they seem to be able to induce coma or death under the right conditions &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m honestly scared,i stole some of them from under my mom&amp;#39;s nose while she wasn&amp;#39;t looking,i feel like she knows it because when i checked the next time they weren&amp;#39;t there&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m afraid,afraid that they won&amp;#39;t work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m afraid that they will,I don&amp;#39;t know why,but the thought terrifies me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had them safe and guarded in a place I&amp;#39;m sure no one will find&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my last attempts were my emotions trumping logic,I was able to not kill myself but I couldn&amp;#39;t take it,now it feels the opposite,I have nothing going for me,my life is a hellish standstill,I have begun to think of it as euthanasia &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at a loss,it&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m here in the first place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trapped in a room with no doors or windows
The air is stale
I have been given a knife
I hope it&amp;#39;s sharp&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hey, sorry I tried to post this on r/teenagers but I have a low karma threshold :/

Anyway, yes I know in 10 years I won't care but this matters to me now.

Okay so, i'm in 8th grade and I have a ""best"" friend for 4 years. She has a lot of mental health problems but so do I. I'm always there for her and stuff (or at least I try) and I even helped her clean her room when she was depressed. In our relationship I usually feel like i'm always starting conversations and doing most of the work. However this has gotten worse lately. She never talks to me about anything. She got into trouble that she told me only after I pressed her about drugs and stuff. Now her depression and anxiety has gotten so bad that she is going to a mental health program to deal with stuff. Good for her. (One last thing, she posted on YOLO that anonymous app, saying that ""I wasn't as good of a friend as I thought I was"" and stuff. I know it was her cause it used words only she used and she was the only person at that point to look at my post. For the record, I have talked her through 5 public mental breakdowns, and taken 4 years of her shit. I'm doing my best and when i'm upset she handles it so badly). A few months ago we were at a thing and I find her crying in the hallway. Being a good friend I do my best to comfort her-missing 20 minutes of work I could be doing. Anyway she has a whole rant and stuff and I say stuff that I really regret now. She was talking about how messed up her life was and how she needed to fix her problems with her sleep and her friends and stuff. The 2 things I should not have said are ""If they're really your friends they'll be there as long as you need"" and ""I will never leave you"". Now I want to leave but I feel trapped. I don't want to break my promise or hurt her more than she already is, but it's making me more depressed and If I was her I couldn't take someone I cared about leaving me when I'm in such a fragile spot....

For the record, I have talked her through 5 public mental breakdowns, and taken 4 years of her shit. I&amp;#39;m doing my best and when i&amp;#39;m upset she handles it so badly). A few months ago we were at a thing and I find her crying in the hallway. Being a good friend I do my best to comfort her-missing 20 minutes of work I could be doing. Anyway she has a whole rant and stuff and I say stuff that I really regret now. She was talking about how messed up her life was and how she needed to fix her problems with her sleep and her friends and stuff. The 2 things I should not have said are &amp;quot;If they&amp;#39;re really your friends they&amp;#39;ll be there as long as you need&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I will never leave you&amp;quot;. Now I want to leave but I feel trapped. I don&amp;#39;t want to break my promise or hurt her more than she already is, but it&amp;#39;s making me more depressed and If I was her I couldn&amp;#39;t take someone I cared about leaving me when I&amp;#39;m in such a fragile spot....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please tell me what I should do.&lt;/p&gt;

I tried to kill myself back in '13. It was bad, I spent 6 months in the hospital because of it. I have scars that are impossible to ignore.

The thought of killing myself has never left me. But it has gotten easier to deal with over time. One of the main factors for me, personally, is that my mother would visit me on the weekends when I was in the hospital. And that my First Sergeant (now a retired CSM) would regularly visit me just to ""shoot the shit"".

Every time that my mom came to visit me I could tell that she had been crying before hand and was just trying to be strong. That shit fucking hurt. Every time my First Sergeant met with me he would be in civilian clothing and he would tell me how worried the other men in my unit were about me. That shit hurt too.

I think about killing myself every day. But it's gotten better. It's different for everyone, but sometimes you can find a way to push through things even when you have given up before.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi. 

My girlfriend of 3 years has had some pretty tough days, and been down to point of were she doesn't want to talk, or in general do anything. I came home today, to her laying in her bed starring into the wall, and just crying. 

I tried to comfort her, but she ""doesn't"" want to talk about it. I gave her a little room yesterday to breathe, as she usually wants to process her thoughts first, before wanting to talk about them. 

Finally I made some grounds, and she told me that she is tired of fighting and just wants to end it all. I off course told her otherwise, but she believes, that she isn't worth anything and the world would be a better place without her, and she stands her grounds on that. 

I maybe became a little frustrated, and now she feels like I blame her (for wanting to kill herself) instead of trying to comfort her.  I think I got scared for a moment, and I really tried to understand her feelings, but how couldn't I? Was she expecting me to just lay down and accept that my girlfriend wants to fucking end her life? 

I found out by reading in her journal (yes, I know. Bad move, but I was worried, as she has tried to commit suicide before), that she maybe plans to kill herself this Thursday. I will be calling her treatment-center tomorrow, to tell them everything. 

She suffers from Schizotypy, and is in threatment. Actually, for the first time in her life, the treatment actually works, and she is making progress, but she feels that whatever she does, and no matter the treatment, she will never be able to work or function in this society (which is a lie. She just needs to start out slowly).

Unfortunately i was not able to have erection because i was on antidepressants and I couldn't tell her because she wouldn't accept it as for depression she would thought about it as psychological problems ( i know her very well ) .

She never allowed me to try it back again we only would make it out through ( handjob , blowjob,ect...) . And it was normal with erection for like 6 times and failed with two due to emotional stress i had .

One day after making out she dumped me out of the blue without telling me the reason saying im a good guy and treats women very well but we are not a match .

Me and my ex works together at the same place with people who know me and my family very well and found out that my ex told someone that the reason she dumped me for was my bad erection and that person spread it all around .

,SuicideWatch," 

i feel like I have no life, it is just very easy for me to say that. I have no life. I have no life, I do not have a life. I wish I’m already a part of something. A lot of times I just don’t feel like I’m a part of anything. I don’t feel like it’s necessary for me to live right now. I don’t think I matter. I’m just there, all I do is wrong. I can’t get it out of my head. It is difficult. Sometimes I can’t breathe just thinking about how I can’t breathe. I want to like myself. I want to love myself. But I just wish I am interested at people. When I am, I tell it straight to their face. Am I just trying to be edgy? I ask myself that question all the time. Because a lot of times when I ask myself that question, I just want to die. I just don’t mind not existing if that question is to be brought up. I especially hate it when my sisters trigger me. A lot actually. I get triggered by them so much, they just couldn’t deal with me, I think. That is exactly why I punched myself in the face, because they made me feel like a creep. Like I’m so unlikeable, like I’m just asking for attention. But really, I’m just trying to live my best life, trying all the things that I want to do. I am trying to be non-toxic to myself. To others, to my friends. I readily don’t feel like I have any friends. It’s hard to reach out when every time I see people, my friends, they do not want to be intimate with me. I feel like all my friendships, the best kinships I’ve ever experienced were with people that are able to become vulnerable. I feel like I’ve put myself in vulnerable positions very frequently, however I’ve also felt burnt out very frequently. I’m tired of living. I am scared. But I don’t want to die, I want to live and be happy. I feel disgusting almost all the time. My butt hurts. When it hurts, it is a constant reminder that I’m disgusting and unlikeable. I hate myself so much I just want to become a void. A black void, oh I will be! I cried a lot, I’ve wasted a lot of time. I love wasting time, that is my best expertise. Why is it so hard to keep my butt clean? I heard my butt smells also come out of my mouth.

I have no life. I have no life, I do not have a life. I wish I’m already a part of something. A lot of times I just don’t feel like I’m a part of anything. I don’t feel like it’s necessary for me to live right now. I don’t think I matter. I’m just there, all I do is wrong. I can’t get it out of my head. It is difficult. Sometimes I can’t breathe just thinking about how I can’t breathe. I want to like myself. I want to love myself. But I just wish I am interested at people. When I am, I tell it straight to their face. Am I just trying to be edgy? I ask myself that question all the time. Because a lot of times when I ask myself that question, I just want to die. I just don’t mind not existing if that question is to be brought up. I especially hate it when my sisters trigger me. A lot actually. I get triggered by them so much, they just couldn’t deal with me, I think. That is exactly why I punched myself in the face, because they made me feel like a creep. Like I’m so unlikeable, like I’m just asking for attention. But really, I’m just trying to live my best life, trying all the things that I want to do. I am trying to be non-toxic to myself. To others, to my friends. I readily don’t feel like I have any friends. It’s hard to reach out when every time I see people, my friends, they do not want to be intimate with me. I feel like all my friendships, the best kinships I’ve ever experienced were with people that are able to become vulnerable. I feel like I’ve put myself in vulnerable positions very frequently, however I’ve also felt burnt out very frequently. I’m tired of living. I am scared. But I don’t want to die, I want to live and be happy. I feel disgusting almost all the time. My butt hurts. When it hurts, it is a constant reminder that I’m disgusting and unlikeable. I hate myself so much I just want to become a void. A black void, oh I will be! I cried a lot, I’ve wasted a lot of time. I love wasting time, that is my best expertise. Why is it so hard to keep my butt clean? I heard my butt smells also come out of my mouth.

&lt;p&gt;Today I was feeling okay, butit just happened and now I&amp;#39;m not so good anymore. There&amp;#39;s someone that I really want to talk to, but I just can&amp;#39;t. And I don&amp;#39;t understand why I just can&amp;#39;t. It makes me feel so bad...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to be alone, but I can&amp;#39;t change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m scared and tired. I don&amp;#39;t need to live for myself, but I don&amp;#39;t have anyone else to live for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I&amp;#39;m just waiting for it to happen on a bad day, because I know it will be enough to make me want to go again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;onto why im asking for advice on what to do. i want to die again, and its just getting worse. i keep having thoughts about killing myself daily now, and i just want it all to end. the thing is, when im thinking straight, i dont want to die. it would make that a few people sad, and i would do anything in the world from making those people sad. i want to live a long and fulfilled life, but i just dont know if ill able to handle life any longer. i dont think ill be able to decide on my own what to do, and i know if i do make a decision i wont follow through on it without someone expecting me to actually follw that decision. so im asking, should i tell this person about my thoughts and/or should i ask for therapy or are there any alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

I've occasionally lurked in this community and since i don't know where else to ask i will do it here.

It's been almost 10 years and all i feel is emptiness whenever i am alone/doing nothing and pretty severe sadness when i fuck up something.  


The thing is that this sadness brings me to what i think are suicidal thoughts.

I keep thinking at suicide methods (especially hanging) and the thoughts keep going for hours.
