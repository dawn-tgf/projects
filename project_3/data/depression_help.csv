,depression_help,"As I write this, reddit suggested me to add a flair requesting support, even though I don't even know if that's what I really need or want... Maybe I just want to share a little bit of my story with someone before I vanish...  


I used to be a smart kid despite dyslexia, it took me a while to get the hang of reading and writing, but once I got it, I enjoyed it a lot. My father was an alcoholic and he would beat me to within an inch of life daily, so books and fantasy became my haven. I'm not trying to justify his actions, but I can't really blame him that much. My parents, they didn't want a son and once my mom got pregnant, they discovered she had a heart condition. She would spend the next 15 years in hospitals having surgery after surgery. I guess my dad didn't take it very well, they were a young couple in financial difficulties, then a newborn and such a serious medical condition, I'm sure this is likely to disturb anyone...  


Fast forward some 17 years, I had finished high-school and all I wanted was to move out and not to get beaten every day. I still had a lot of anger inside of me, I was young and dumb. I pretty much never had a clear goal in my life so far. My friends used to talk about how they dreamed to become doctors, dentists, veterinarians and such, while all I ever wanted was to survive. Not sure if this is what really cause my complete lack of ambition or if I was already broken...  


During high-school I saved some money while going through lot of different odd jobs  and such. When I finally graduated I moved to the state's capital by myself. Some 200 miles away from my hometown that place was somewhat scary. My hometown had some 60,000 inhabitants and suddenly I was living in this metropolis surrounded by 12,000,000 people, it was a rush, I quickly found a place to stay and in less than a week I had a job. Not bad, I though to myself...

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't take long for me to meet a girl. She was a sweet little thing, we fell in love like the two dumb teenagers we were. She was a little older than me and she had a son already. A couple of months later I rented a house and she and her son moved in with me, we adopted some cats and we had a little garden. Those I think were the best months of my life. But good things don't seem to last and the company I was working for ended up going under and like that I saw myself staring at my over due bills...

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going real bad as I couldn't find another job and the money was running out. If I was alone, I probably could've pulled through, but now I had them to take care of, so I ended up joining the Marines so I could support them. I never saw myself as a military man until that, but we gotta do what we gotta do.  


I rather not to go in details about my service, except for the fact I spent four years deployed. It was around that time I first felt I was losing control over this darkness inside of me. In my last six months I couldn't even call her. I kept sending the checks, but I just couldn't bear talking to her... I had this weight upon my shoulders, I felt ashamed and dirty... I didn't even tell her when I came back, I just showed up at the front yard... I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't bring myself to knock on the door. It was raining as I stood there for some time, not sure how long, eventually the neighbors called the cops and she went out when they arrived...  


I remember feeling terrible as she hugged me and cried. I felt awkward and scared, not sure why, I just didn't feel at home. It felt like I was trying to fit into someone else's life... That's when the nightmares begun. They kept her up all night, it was horrible and eventually I moved out of the house... I told her I would keep paying the bills for them, but she just left...  


That's when I got into drinking. I spent two years drenched in alcohol until one day I had a cardiac arrest due to alcohol poisoning... I tried to kill myself three times before that, but I ended up quitting because I was only hurting whoever still cared a little bit for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Things actually didn't get any better after I quit. To be completely honest, it all got a lot worse after... Fast forward some years and I'm here... I am 30 years old, I'm barely making through between long time unemployment and some odd jobs, I'm earning enough to pay the rent and feed my cats even though sometimes I don't have food for myself, not that it matters anyway as I barely have any appetite. I can't keep any relationships, be it friends or girlfriends, I'm always alone. My house is covered in trash as I just can't bring myself to clean anything and I can't remember the last time I had a bath.  


I'm writing this right now because I didn't get any sleep in the last four days and I just needed to share this with someone. I'm not even sure if I'll actually post it or just delete it after I finish writing it, like I already did many times before... I feel embarrassed and scared all the time. Every morning I close my windows in shame and I sneak around my own house in fear my neighbors would realize I'm here. Every little noise I hear gets my mind racing, thinking about the police storming into my house because someone might have complained about the smell... I just feel like a complete failure, an embarrassment, I feel like I threw my life away and I just can't come back from all my bad decisions, but at the same time I feel this sickening despair flooding my brain to do something now...  


I try to do my best for my cats... I keep their litter box clean and I always get them the most expensive food, but the rest is completely abandoned... I feel like people would commit me to an institution if anyone saw they way I've been living and even knowing that I just don't have the strength to do anything about it... Countless times I started to gather all the trash and cleaning the house just to collapse on the trash and lie there... Sometimes I even manage to, but then I feel too embarrassed to throw all that trash out and end up exposing myself like that...  


It's been some long years since I last tried to kill myself, but lately, I'm feeling like I'm getting cornered more and more each day. I feel like I don't have any other options and I really don't know if I'll get through this time... I just don't feel sad anymore, I can't cry, I can't eat or sleep...  


It's been half-an-hour since I finished typing this and I decided to post it... I'm very sorry if this made you feel sad in anyway, it was not my intention, but for some unknown reason I just needed to share it with someone. I'm very tired and broken and this may well be the last opportunity I have to share my story with someone and for some reason, I belive I deserve at least that.  


I also do it in the hope someone may find some comfort or understanding of what I went through and maybe use it for the betterment of one's life...

,depression_help,"I struggle with mental health no matter what I'm doing but it's manageable until I have to go to school every day. I've had this problem virtually ever since I started elementary school. I'm a freshman in college now. I noticed how bad it was one Monday after a three day weekend. I was feeling great from the little break and the second my feet hit the school grounds, all my anxiety, depression, and negativity his me like a truck.

I can find little things that make life bearable but I'm not really enjoying my time on Earth, especially if you tally up the good days compared to the bad. I have a great therapist but I can't see him that often and he's about to move away. I've lost almost all my friends since high school and haven't made a single real friend since college started. I have a supportive family but I don't have enough people behind me to face going to school anymore.

When I get really scared I shut down. My emotions all turn off and I don't feel anything. I'm getting really sad again but I haven't been able to cry in almost a year (with the exception of the first week of school). It feels nice because I know my brain is protecting me from all the pain I could really be feeling but that blissful ignorance is interrupted when school starts again and everything I've been ignoring comes out all at once. The next semester is starting, and I was so resistant to going back that my brain blocked out the fact that it started today. My brain literally made me forget that school was starting so I missed the first day. I really don't want to go. I can't seem to accept the fact that I'm going to have years more of this agonizing bullshit to go through.

I think anyone who's been through school understands why it sucks, so I don't need to waste time explaining all the reasons why I hate it. I hate being constrained by school or having a tight schedule or set of rules forced on me. But at the same time I struggle with worsening anxiety and I need a hand to hold to get through life on my own. I'm definitely not ready to go to a university or live alone yet. I would probably get suicidal again. I don't want to die but if I get scared enough, I'm worried what I'll do. I'm not going to do anything drastic, but I think about it a lot. I would really like to stop existing but there's a bunch of things I still want to do with my life, I'll worry about dying after that. The problem is, in order to achieve all my goals, I need to get through school. I'm really scared that life after school is still going to suck, if not be worse. I've survived years of serious depression, but after that was over and I got to be happy for a while, another rough patch came on ridiculously quickly. And that was when I was forced to go back to school.

What if life is just an unending cycle of struggles? I feel like I'm fighting to stay afloat, and once I get to breathe I can't enjoy it because I can see the next wave in the horizon.

I&amp;#39;ve had this problem virtually ever since I started elementary school. I&amp;#39;m a freshman in college now. I noticed how bad it was one Monday after a three day weekend. I was feeling great from the little break and the second my feet hit the school grounds, all my anxiety, depression, and negativity his me like a truck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can find little things that make life bearable but I&amp;#39;m not really enjoying my time on Earth, especially if you tally up the good days compared to the bad. I have a great therapist but I can&amp;#39;t see him that often and he&amp;#39;s about to move away. I&amp;#39;ve lost almost all my friends since high school and haven&amp;#39;t made a single real friend since college started. I have a supportive family but I don&amp;#39;t have enough people behind me to face going to school anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get really scared I shut down. My emotions all turn off and I don&amp;#39;t feel anything. I&amp;#39;m getting really sad again but I haven&amp;#39;t been able to cry in almost a year (with the exception of the first week of school). It feels nice because I know my brain is protecting me from all the pain I could really be feeling but that blissful ignorance is interrupted when school starts again and everything I&amp;#39;ve been ignoring comes out all at once. The next semester is starting, and I was so resistant to going back that my brain blocked out the fact that it started today. My brain literally made me forget that school was starting so I missed the first day. I really don&amp;#39;t want to go. I can&amp;#39;t seem to accept the fact that I&amp;#39;m going to have years more of this agonizing bullshit to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think anyone who&amp;#39;s been through school understands why it sucks, so I don&amp;#39;t need to waste time explaining all the reasons why I hate it. I hate being constrained by school or having a tight schedule or set of rules forced on me. But at the same time I struggle with worsening anxiety and I need a hand to hold to get through life on my own. I&amp;#39;m definitely not ready to go to a university or live alone yet. I would probably get suicidal again. I don&amp;#39;t want to die but if I get scared enough, I&amp;#39;m worried what I&amp;#39;ll do. I&amp;#39;m not going to do anything drastic, but I think about it a lot. I would really like to stop existing but there&amp;#39;s a bunch of things I still want to do with my life, I&amp;#39;ll worry about dying after that. The problem is, in order to achieve all my goals, I need to get through school. I&amp;#39;m really scared that life after school is still going to suck, if not be worse. I&amp;#39;ve survived years of serious depression, but after that was over and I got to be happy for a while, another rough patch came on ridiculously quickly. And that was when I was forced to go back to school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if life is just an unending cycle of struggles? I feel like I&amp;#39;m fighting to stay afloat, and once I get to breathe I can&amp;#39;t enjoy it because I can see the next wave in the horizon. I don&amp;#39;t want to live like this but I&amp;#39;m too weak to fight through it in this state. It&amp;#39;s not that I want to give up, but I don&amp;#39;t know what to do to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

she likes younger guys also said she wanted a relationship but the way she was acting kept making me believe she wanted sex, cause she sent me nudes without me asking on our 1st videocall she teased me,on the dates she kept talking about sex,on the 3rd date she mention that she wanted to see my penis in flaccid state while I was in her car, another thing she said that in order to be in a relationship with her we needed to have sex a few times to see how I make her feel in bed and also go out with her a little more to public places to see how I would react when she begins to have a panic attack in public, but for some reason kept making me wait,on the very 1st dates she was telling me she suffered from panic attacks,anxiety,ocd and because of that depression.Also on the 1st 3 dates she was the one who invited me out and also the one who pay on the dates.The last one it was me.\n\nBut here is when things get weird, since we stopped texting she was barely entering the places were she use to chat with me, the main ones were whatsapp and snapchat I\'m talking about days without being online, she did watched my stories on snapchat from time to time,also everytime I sent her a picture of me on snapchat she would saved or a long message she would saved even after she ghosted me,she doesnt usually save our snapchat convos.When she does gets online is only very late at night and for a few minutes also most of the time not all the time but most when she text with me she always replied late at night like at 4 am.She blocked me from her phone number but not on all the other places were we chatted the most, we actually never text or call through phone number it was always on whatsapp.She doesnt have social media but 2 weeks after she stopped replying she made a private IG and posted some pics in which one of the pics it was a picture she sent me earlier when we 1st started texting were she is in her bed showing her ass and also put and adreess that it seems it looks like is her house.And that\'s very weird to me, also that IG that she made it looks like she doesnt enter there that much either.\n\nAnother thing most of the pictures that she post are old pictures and it looks like they are pictures taken from another phone like she took another phone to take a picture of the screen of the other phone were the picture is, weird I suggest.She is by far the weirdiest and most mysterious female I have dated.Another thing she lives with her parents and said she had 4 abortions, never been married and she doesnt wanna have kids cause that would make her anxiety worse.It looks like she likes to have sex a lot cause she talked about that a lot with me in dates.Doesnt have any friends male or female.Doesnt like kissing on the mouth even tho I made her do it.Now almost a month had pass since last time I sent her a message and I sent her a message on whatsapp days ago it was a picture saying Happy New Year but the reason I sent this it was to verify if she had me on her contacts cause I know a function on whatsapp to verify that.You sent a message through a group and if the person saw the message it means they have you on their contacts.\n\nShe saw it ignored it but reply like 7 hours later reply with a thank you,then I text her again saying if something happen to her and she said ""you know why I\'m like this, we already talk about this.I thought you understood me"" I know she was talking about her depression etc.She started replying to me again after ghosting me for a month.I told her I understood her but I did not undertand why she became distant with me in just 2 days and she said "" Im like that,I told you"" then I ask her are you bipolar and she said ""no, if you dont understand me then why keep talking"" I said I understand I just wanna know you more and she said doesnt look like it, now she is replying to me again but her answers are kind of cold like last time, leaves me on read sometimes but I text her again and she keeps replying and is not texting 1st but atleast she is replying but I dont know if I should believe her if that was really the reason why she ghosted me.I mean I believe her that she suffer from all that she showed me the pills she was taking for her mental illness and kept talking about it and she does have a lot signs of someone not mentally alright but I\'m not really sure.I have not invited her out yet now but I feel like she is gonna say no or leave me on read again or she might say yes I\'m not really sure. \n\nMy question is if she not interested,why she doesn\'t just tell me and that\'s it, I have told her if it is that she simply can just say it that is not gonna harm me at all is just gonna save me time but the last time I told her that she ignore that message,why replying

,depression_help,"Tl;dr: I live with my parents and don't have a proper job because of mental health problems. My friends are doing great and they have good jobs, own homes etc. I shouldn't feel inadequate but I do, I feel ashamed. 

I'm 31 and I live with my parents and do some work part time but I don't earn anywhere near enough to afford to live indepently.

I had a difficult time at school because I was bullied a lot and found it hard to make friends. I went to uni when I was 18 and again I struggled to make friends at first but in my final year I finally felt included by a good group of friends for the first time in my life.

I had problems with depression through my teenage years and anxiety from childhood. At uni my anxiety got a whole lot worse. When I was 21 and graduated, I moved back home, where my parents pressured me into doing an internship straight away even though I was ill. I burned out and had my first complete mental breakdown. After that, it became a cycle of short term jobs and breakdowns. I managed to live independently for over 2 years but then I had to move back in with my parents for practical and financial reasons. They're retired and my mum is disabled so they value having me around to help, even though they can be quite critical of me at times. 

In the past few years I've done some temporary jobs and right now I have some work I can do from home and some self employed work. My mental health is much more stable but I'm earning less than half of what I earned working full time as I work less than 20 hours most weeks. But as I'm living with my parents I've got enough money for the things I want to do. 

In my home town most of the people I know I've met through mental health services and most of them don't work, so I don't feel weird about not having a proper job. 

I still see some of the friends I made at uni but I find it difficult because they all earn a lot more than me and they've got their own homes. I feel like I've got stuck where they were 9-10 years ago.  When we meet up they talk about stuff like bills, appliances and interior design. I'm still sleeping in the same room I've had since I was 10, which is a mess because I've got more stuff than I can fit in one room. 

I feel like when I used to play Mario Kart Wii with my friends at uni and I was really bad at it at first, so I'd end up driving the wrong way and getting lapped. I feel like I've been lapped and I'm watching my friends move further and further ahead of me. 

I know the theory about not comparing myself to others and I know they will be struggling under the surface with life too. But I can't shake the feelings of shame at my situation when I'm with my friends and it makes me almost not want to see them. I feel ashamed telling new people that I live with my parents, too.

,depression_help,I'm a 19 yo guy. I have been depressed for the past 4 years of my life. I had a ray of hope when I started dating a girl. And just after few months into the relationship she left. I suffer from depression everyday. It's too hard to move on. I find difficult to connect with people. I don't have many friends that understand depression and try to help me. I feel lonely everytime.

,depression_help,"So I recently realised that I may have been abused as a child. I'm currently attending uni and decided to just use the resources it provides. Long story short, I met with a professional and was very quickly diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) due to unpleasantly intrusive thoughts/memories and avoidance of objects that remind me of the abuse (My mum always wore heavy boots and carried a large key ring. I can vividly imagine the sound of her angry footsteps and her jingling keys, and both put me on edge so much so that I can't carry keys on a ring or wear clothing/footwear similar to hers). The reasons behind the diagnosis aren't of critical importance though.

I'm not sure what I expected from the diagnosis. Relief? Comfort? Justification? I honestly can't say for sure. Part of me thought it would somehow make things better in that it would provide some sort of justification for my feelings, some name and definition with a definitive course of action. Part of me thought it would finally prove that I do indeed feel the way I claim to, since some of my mates accuse me of lying, fabricating, or exaggerating what I try to describe.

Regardless of the possibilities, I was convinced that it would help make things better.

Obvious throwaway.  
Not attention seeking but more seeking advice....

All I have been thinking about the past 2 weeks.  
I'm currently 16.  
I'm very introverted and shy with almost no social skills. I stay away from everyone. Getting bullied all the time.  
That's why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC's being an escape from that.  
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.  
On top of that I have realized I'm 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I've never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?  
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.  
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?  
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.  
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.  
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.  
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.  
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?  
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.  
But im losing hope every day more and more.  
I feel like I dont wanna talk about anything of this with my parents.

That&amp;#39;s why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC&amp;#39;s being an escape from that.&lt;br/&gt;
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.&lt;br/&gt;
On top of that I have realized I&amp;#39;m 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I&amp;#39;ve never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?&lt;br/&gt;
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.&lt;br/&gt;
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?&lt;br/&gt;
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.&lt;br/&gt;
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.&lt;br/&gt;
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.&lt;br/&gt;
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.&lt;br/&gt;
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?&lt;br/&gt;
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.&lt;br/&gt;
But im losing hope every day more and more.&lt;br/&gt;
I feel like I dont wanna talk about anything of this with my parents.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m awaiting to finish high school and then try to tackle life myself.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"(Cw suicide mention and self harm) 

My depression was out of control the last 3 weeks. It comes in cycles and I may not have the proper diagnosis. 

This time it was so bad that 3 weeks ago I put a lighter to my arm in places until I couldn't anymore. I'd had a panic attack and could not calm down despite my prescription Klonopin. 

Thursday night, I wanted to do this again before I healed and got an unexpected call from my mother. We don't talk much about my mental health, but we live 2 hours away, so we see each other a lot, so she sees my cycles of highs and lows. I was sobbing and word vomited about my constant suicidal ideation eating at my brain. I am always aware the thoughts are irrational, but they are overwhelming. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this coming Monday, but we agreed to meet halfway at a good hospital the next morning. Screw work, I need to get my head on straight! I begged her to let me sleep in since I'd been sleep deprived for weeks and she agreed that I would call her in the morning. We made plans for me to come stay at home for a while so I can get better. I've been battling this since I was 7 years old, and I am 23 now! I want to be happy, so I thought ""Hell yeah! Let's get my brain working right this time!""

I woke up at 7:30ish AM to banging on the door. My roommate's boyfriend assumed it was our annoying neighbor. Banging again. I put on some sweatpants and look in the peep hole and it's the police! ""Are you Casey xXxX?"" they ask. My heart sank. I tell them to come on inside and they explained they had a distress call. I let them into my bedroom and look at my phone to see so many missed calls from my worried mother. While they were in my room, I call her and say ""WHY DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?!"" but she was sobbing and scared and worried for me. 

I had to cooperate and let them take me through a back entrance to some emergency room type deal to be mentally evaluated. I thanked them for my first ride in a cop car. I got temporarily locked in a room where I called and broke up with my absolutely unsupportive boyfriend. I let a few close friends know what was up. 

After a mental evaluation, I was thrown in a taxi with no idea where I was going. I had to ask a staff member 3 times where I would be so my parents (who were high tailing it to see me) could know where I was going. I get dropped off with no clue where to go in this dirty rehab facility. The staff were rude and the amazing cleaning staffwoman helped me find where to go and comforted me more than any counselor. 

I went inside to see what the deal about being admitted was. More rules than a prison. No personal belongings - not even my music. I didn't have my books with me or any belongings. Forced group therapy (I HATE GROUP THERAPY). I refused and got an attitude from the staff lady. I walked into the lobby and just cried and waited on my parents to take me home. A doctor of sorts gave me a juice to take my medicine since I hadn't eaten or drank all day and it was almost 1 PM at this point. 

When my parents finally arrived, we got ahold of a place who will do inpatient-outpatient care! We went to pack a bag for me, and my roommate is lovingly taking care of my cat. I start Monday. Alongside psychiatry, I hope they have some kind of therapy that isn't the norm. I will chat for a bit, but I've dreamt of art or music therapy. I want to create. I cook to calm my soul. I can't be locked in a room like the woman from the Yellow Wallpaper. It's not for me. 

So wish me luck as I start a new and different journey of intense treatment. My parents are being very helpful and supportive. My mom was extremely apologetic about the police. Living with them is very stressful and we are setting major boundaries. I'm going to move back to my hometown in my own little place once I am feeling better and can get a job where I excel (I've been job hopping badly through these cycles). I might be able to finish up my degree at the local tech school, too! I've also given up alcohol until March or April - I don't have a drinking problem, just not allowing anything to make things worse. Only healthy foods and yoga every day is happening. I feel very hopeful. I still have that voice tugging at me and crying spells, but it's going to get better. I am going to get better!!!!!!!

Any advice about how to deal with therapy (I really hated CBT and group therapy) would be great. I've only ever been to a psychiatrist and a few therapy/counseling sessions for the last 3 years. Or, I'd also love advice on the situation in general.

,depression_help,"I was abandoned by my father since I was 17 years old and I lived in a developing country. So, I could not get support from the government for my living and education. The subsidy in my country based on family approval and bureaucracy and my dad never applied it to me and decided to disappear. Last year I discovered that I was adopted by my parents.

It was hard to get a job and I was very poor. I barely ate food twice a week to save money. I could not get a good job (a decent salary, good working environment, stable contract) and keep got a scam job (job description different from the reality etc). Somehow without grades, jobs I got a job only in a hotel, cafe, bar, restaurant and those jobs sell body/appearance in my country. Office jobs always rejected me. I was very traumatic because the environment was really bad, I got harassment, promotion based on an affair with the boss or foreign shareholders, etc.

I decided to fix my life by savings for education but the university without subsidy is too much for me. And, in my country, I have a time limit for subsidy 2 years after high school and it was impossible for me to apply. Then, I enrolled in vocational college but still in the tourism industry. It was still hard for me to get a job even I graduate because the degree is not that popular. But I decided to take the master and abroad because there are many opportunities for scholarship abroad.

I got a partial scholarship so I need to contribute for flights, first settlement allowance etc. But, I don't expect if I live with low scholarship allowance in western Europe is very difficult

I thought life is similar to my country but in Europe money is needed more than in my country to be independent and not rely on other people. Students from my country mostly snobs here so they won't care about my difficult life. Work also very hard due to my resident permit. I had lots of debt for moving here. I got harassed and bullied by snobs students from my country. They also make a group based on social status. But to find local friends is very difficult. If I need help or something I need to pay. I am too stressed and my grades suck. I demotivated and committed suicide. Local people told me I should do sports and association. I am not used with sports and join clubs to get friends and be active (for me it just a waste of money). I am not used that I need to go to psychoa logist to talk (usually with friends). I am not used with spending money on happiness such as vacation etc. I also stressed out too many students focus on sex-oriented here, so that, finding a true friend is difficult.

People from my country told me the best way to get out of the problem is to marry someone. It is a culture that poor women need to marry but I don't want. On the other hand, I don't have an option. Even my embassy told me without family then no one would help you now. They advised me to have a family. I only need a friend but with my age now, people are busy getting mates and family, so it seems only partner/boyfriend that would listen to me, give me support and help.

,depression_help,"I’ve been having a rough go of things.  I just discovered this subreddit, and thought it might be therapeutic to vent.  

Since November 23rd I’ve had a chronic sinus infection.  I’ve had numerous doctors visits and I take the full course of antibiotics, do the inhalers, do the ear drops, do the nose sprays, and I feel better for a bit, then I get worse when it comes back when I finish things and the cycle continues.  and me, being 26 with hardly any idea how the US health insurance system works, am now stuck with a $500 bill after insurance even though nothing works and feels defeating.  On top of that, my livers getting worse from drinking from being depressed.  More on that in a minute.  The upside to the sinus infection is I’ve stopped smoking and vaping for a month as of today.  I Smoked from 15-19 and from 23-26 and since I started back up, I’ve had no success as long as I have today.  So you’d think I’d be proud.  

However, I’ve been maniacally depressed since Christmas Eve.  I’ve cried myself to sleep every night since then.  Felt suicidal.  The whole 9 yards.  I’ve dealt with depression since a young age.  I’ve tried killing myself numerous times over my life, but it’s either failed, or I couldn’t follow through from fear.  So I constantly feel as though I’d be better off dead, but too cowardly to commit.  A big part of this is living at home.  

In 2015 I moved back home and dropped out of school due to a bad semester, two severe car accidents that make me fear driving in wintry weather, and numerous other things.  I consistently fight with my mother especially.  I WANT to move out.  But due to my financial setbacks that keep coming up, I cannot.  And I feel consistently defeated.  

My mother used to be my closer parent.  But as we’ve aged she’s no longer comforting.  But harsh.  I can’t remember the last time I saw her genuinely happy without faking it.  She claims she doesn’t have bipolar disorder, but I don’t know which mother I’ll get sometimes.  The normal one, or one where she’ll walk in screaming and targeting people.  I have bipolar disorder.  But I’m medicated for it.  As well as my depression.  My mother also will go out of her way to bring her negativity onto other family members.  She’s very unhappy.  She smokes pot at night and has an overeating disorder that makes me uncomfortable to see her that way because she’ll try to talk to me when I get off work and I can’t hold a conversation because she’s in a haze.  I no longer feel comfortable telling her my problems.  She either doesn’t listen, or is harsh about my concerns.  

My dad on the other hand refuses to let me speak when I try and tell him what’s wrong.  I’ll cry and try to explain why I’m upset, but he constantly interrupts after I ask him to stop, or he’ll blame it on me,  I try and ask him to let me finish why I’m upset, but he won’t listen.  And after a number of attempts I just stop talking and don’t say anything and he’ll try and “comfort” me but it feels hollow because I haven’t gotten my points out, and they just feel useless.   

I’ve recently tried reaching out to my middle brother (who my mother hates because he’s left the stoop and is married and has all kinds of ill will against him and his wife) and I don’t know who to believe about my little brother because part of me doesn’t believe my mom, part of me does.  He’s been supportive.  He’s all I’ve got right now to listen to me.  My youngest brother (I’m the oldest of 3) is 17 and I don’t think he’s mature enough to handle what I’m dealing with.  

I’m seriously at the end of my rope.  I feel I have no one to explain my depression to, to comfort me, or anything.  My family keeps pushing me further and further away.  My friends have expressed they’re fed up with me saying I’m depressed.  And I feel I have no other routes to take.  I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 28th but I don’t want to be put back on more meds.  He’s seen me my whole life.  And I need a counselor.  Or someone to talk to.  I just feel powerless.  Useless.  Like I’ll never break free and my family is pulling away from me.

I just want to give up at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve been having really bad mood swings, which is quite new, and it affects me. Just out of nowhere I&amp;#39;d be sad or angry over something and end up hurting myself. I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m like this. I just can&amp;#39;t keep myself together and control my emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a year since I started going to a psychiatrist, but honestly it just doesn&amp;#39;t help at all. Those pills they give me don&amp;#39;t even work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything&amp;#39;s hopeless. I can&amp;#39;t save myself, and nobody can save me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no choice but to live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hi, so I'm an amateur artist (like REALLY amateur), my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I can't seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing (on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightly-less-s\*\*\*-than-usual drawing at least) so feeling like my art is stuck at the sub-deviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. It's getting to the point that I'm beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the self-hatred at bay.

The problem is that I don't know WTF I'm supposed to do about it.

So some background, she and I have been together since July 2019, I've learned a few things that I had not  previously known before hand, like that she has anxiety and depression and she gave me an opportunity to  opt out of the relationship.

everything went relatively smoothly from there, can't think of any major scenarios but  then October 23rd she called me crying and saying she didn't want to live anymore and that there was no  reason for her to be here, kept  me up late  but I  was able  to calm her down enough and we both went to sleep,  and  she was still there in the morning,  a date I haven't forgotten, I was  on edge of different things after then but eventually  I thought things began to be handled.

January 12th turns out I was wrong.  same situation as before except  more  dire, there was a point where I almost had to call  her dad.  Her dad is aware  of the depression and later will be talked more about. I knew  that she would hate me if  I did but I  had really thought she was going to do it/doing it, I ended up  not having to as she called me after I had said that--I thought it was to break up with me honestly--I  was  able to  keep her  on the line and eventually we went to sleep and again she was there in the morning. Something I continue to pray for.

present time: It's exam  season, we're in  high school, everyone's stressed, which I know isn't helping, the night before the first exam she ignored me  after  I mentioned studying for her  exam.

Today was  our second exam (before  situation got worked out) after the exams we would  go to my  house and do whatever. We  both had a great time and  eventually  she had to leave, we're about a 45 minute drive apart now because she's moved to a different city, but stayed in school with all her friends ( and myself) so she had gone down to the bus station and they hadn't let her on the bus to get back to her city, so she called me crying, her dad went to pick her up.

Once she  arrives home, she hadn't texted me on the drive, which i found irregular but i  thought  she had just been stressed, then I get a message that says :

""You're going  to be mad at me""

so we get into that and she says that she jumped  out of the car while it was  moving, she tried reassuring me with the fact she said it  was slowing down but she said her dad refused to pull over when asked to, so  she did that...I let her explain everything  to me without much comment,  she said  she was okay, she called me and we talked about it there for a bit, she said she knew I was mad at her and could not deal with someone who would be mad at her as it  would increase anxiety.  She also  says I need to actually  do research on her conditions because it seems like I don't care, and proceeded to break up with me, happened before, I get  to  find out if it's real or not tomorrow. Was I mad? well  yes, honestly, I never voiced it but she said she heard it and that had stopped conversation. I hadn't been saying much as well i wasn't happy with what just happened, so the understandably so the silence that I  kept leaving also made it  seem like I was  more mad, there wasn't much conversation that I could  have  without  getting to mad, because the questions I had on my mind were things like ""What was going through your head"" and ""What were you thinking"" so i chose to be quiet instead, sadly its something I've had to do before.

&amp;#x200B;

I  just need some advice on this, she's gone to bed now, which i think is  a good idea, but I need  someone  to help me understand, or send  links for me to help me. I do what I can when we're together to keep her happy but when she  goes  home it's hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Another  note that might be relevant  is she's talking  to  her ex boyfriend again,  not that  I really  think to much of it but today she was trying to  hide that she had been texting him, neither of them are that kind of people, she knows I know  it's happening because I said it was  okay because she said it helped some when I wasn't understanding (previous relationship was 2 years with him) and recently with the increase in exchange texts between them, even when I'm with her  in person worries me as I  don't know what it  is  they talk  about, and I don't ask, I put a lot of trust  into her.",t2_2bp89gc4,False,,0,False,My girlfriend (17F) recent event....,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_etmf74,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579957102.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(sorry for length + formatting + grammar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January 12th turns out I was wrong.  same situation as before except  more  dire, there was a point where I almost had to call  her dad.  Her dad is aware  of the depression and later will be talked more about. I knew  that she would hate me if  I did but I  had really thought she was going to do it/doing it, I ended up  not having to as she called me after I had said that--I thought it was to break up with me honestly--I  was  able to  keep her  on the line and eventually we went to sleep and again she was there in the morning. Something I continue to pray for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;present time: It&amp;#39;s exam  season, we&amp;#39;re in  high school, everyone&amp;#39;s stressed, which I know isn&amp;#39;t helping, the night before the first exam she ignored me  after  I mentioned studying for her  exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was  our second exam (before  situation got worked out) after the exams we would  go to my  house and do whatever. We  both had a great time and  eventually  she had to leave, we&amp;#39;re about a 45 minute drive apart now because she&amp;#39;s moved to a different city, but stayed in school with all her friends ( and myself) so she had gone down to the bus station and they hadn&amp;#39;t let her on the bus to get back to her city, so she called me crying, her dad went to pick her up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once she  arrives home, she hadn&amp;#39;t texted me on the drive, which i found irregular but i  thought  she had just been stressed, then I get a message that says :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re going  to be mad at me&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so we get into that and she says that she jumped  out of the car while it was  moving, she tried reassuring me with the fact she said it  was slowing down but she said her dad refused to pull over when asked to, so  she did that...I let her explain everything  to me without much comment,  she said  she was okay, she called me and we talked about it there for a bit, she said she knew I was mad at her and could not deal with someone who would be mad at her as it  would increase anxiety.  She also  says I need to actually  do research on her conditions because it seems like I don&amp;#39;t care, and proceeded to break up with me, happened before, I get  to  find out if it&amp;#39;s real or not tomorrow. Was I mad? well  yes, honestly, I never voiced it but she said she heard it and that had stopped conversation. I hadn&amp;#39;t been saying much as well i wasn&amp;#39;t happy with what just happened, so the understandably so the silence that I  kept leaving also made it  seem like I was  more mad, there wasn&amp;#39;t much conversation that I could  have  without  getting to mad, because the questions I had on my mind were things like &amp;quot;What was going through your head&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What were you thinking&amp;quot; so i chose to be quiet instead, sadly its something I&amp;#39;ve had to do before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  just need some advice on this, she&amp;#39;s gone to bed now, which i think is  a good idea, but I need  someone  to help me understand, or send  links for me to help me. I do what I can when we&amp;#39;re together to keep her happy but when she  goes  home it&amp;#39;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another  note that might be relevant  is she&amp;#39;s talking  to  her ex boyfriend again,  not that  I really  think to much of it but today she was trying to  hide that she had been texting him, neither of them are that kind of people, she knows I know  it&amp;#39;s happening because I said it was  okay because she said it helped some when I wasn&amp;#39;t understanding (previous relationship was 2 years with him) and recently with the increase in exchange texts between them, even when I&amp;#39;m with her  in person worries me as I  don&amp;#39;t know what it  is  they talk  about, and I don&amp;#39;t ask, I put a lot of trust  into her.&lt;/p&gt;

I think I’m using caffeine to treat my depression because I like the high it gives me.

,depression_help,"Trust me, I'm not technically qualified to give advice on nearly anything, but I'd simply like to share the single most effective tactic I've used to combat my chemical imbalance. 

Firstly, we have all our own strengths and weaknesses, and for many of you this simply may not be an viable option. 

UPDATE: I initally wanted to give advice but feel I cant do that without providing my personal story.

If just a single one of you finds comfort in being reminded you're not alone in fighting an internal battle, it has been worth writing what may become the longest personal essay I've written since.. high school?

So as not to waste the time of any of you who either have physical limitations or litany of other valid reasons this just isn't feasible option:
My secret is 45 minutes of DAILY aerobic exercise.

I know this isn't earth shattering news to the majority of you, but I promise that if your mind/body connections reacts to exercise in a way similar to mine, this is possibly the single most important thing you can do for your overall wellbeing.

Let me provide you with my own ""scientific"" life data to back this up. I've always been naturally athletic;  I'm talking high school varsity level at peak, not overly gifted in the least bit. But up through high school, I had always been physically active whether through games and practices or workouts to gain an edge in between seasons.

For most of us, high school is the last time we had a chance to participate in team sports or other organized activities that forced us to keep active. Once that outlet was gone, it took a few years for me to gradually notice that I was getting more and more depressed as time went on.

Back story, I'd moreso struggled with anxiety rather than that empty feeling of good ol' depression through my childhood and adolescence. So much so that I would have full blown panic attacks, including crying, freezing up and being nearly paralyzed by fear, and sometimes even puking before and sometimes during games or any performance-type thing, starting middle school.

Im blessed to say I have AWESOME parents (another incalculable asset in the personal battle against my own head.) So one day when I was 11 or 12, my mom kind of lied about where we were going and before I realized the situation, we were on a couch across from a therapist. (She had to deceive me, she knew what my reaction was going to be.) I FLIPPED, acting so embarrassing and infantile that to this day I cant believe that man fought through my bull**** and ended up being a tremendous help. I'm talking at least the first 5-6 sessions of me fighting with whichever parent brought me to even get out of the car, going and in telling the Dr to f*** himself in 100 different ways for 30 mins straight while he talked with and assured my parents this was an extreme, but natural way of acting out when feeling cornered etc., walking out of his office multiple times while he just calmly followed me as I circled the halls of the office building just ignoring him until time was up. 

Anyways, after utterly horrifying my parents and wasting God knows how much of their money, I realized he was an truly awesome dude that just wanted to do whatever he could to help teach me coping mechanisms etc etc. I think he won me over cause he told me it was cool if I wanted to swear when telling him about how I felt , and in turn he also swore in conversation, maybe a tactic to make me feel equal? Or like I was just talking to a friend? Cause at 12, the F word just feels cool to say, right? Long story, he made more progress than we could have hoped for in less than a couple years.
Side note: It was all him and the techniques, SSRI's never really seemed to do anything for me, I tried 3 different ones over the course of about 6 months each. Havent taken them since I was like 14

Anyways, fast forward about 15 years and honestly didn't realize how deeply I had spiraled into the prototypical depressive state. Was unaware my s/o and parents had even been keeping in touch behind my back to (in a wholesome way, not the negative connotation) to try to team up and make sure the were doing what they could to help.

I didnt have an aha! moment, but decided I could no longer accept that I was essentially on autopilot and allowing time to trickle away to the point of years. Years since I had felt.. Alive? Enthusiastic? Hard to describe the feeling, or lack thereof.

Anyways, as an adult, it seemed like a no-brainer to see if the therapist who's advice had been paramount not so long ago was still in the area.  Luckily for me, he was, although I didn't know his expertise was technically in adolescents, and didnt typically treat adults.

This is irrelevant, but I can't explain how heartwarming it was when he realized the kid who, in his words, ""fought like a feral animal"" against having to see him had ended up holding him in such high regard that I wanted his help again. This is irrelevant, but I hope he felt as validated as I feel he deserved to.

So we catch up a bit, laugh about what an absolute maniac i had been in our first meetings,  and got to business. He asked the usual questions like what brings you back, describe how you feel, and a couple other basic things.  When I had given him all the basics, he just sighed and said,"" welp kiddo you just hit every bullet point describing classic clinical depression.""

So he took a moment to gather his thoughts and told me based on what he knew about me, the usual approach of long term cognitive behavior therapy would be a complete waste of our time. He also knew that though my brain had fully developed since I was 13,  SSRI's weren't something he thought we should try again, especially I wasnt going to be seeing him weekly

Then he brought up the fact that I had first seen him because of my anxiety getting to actually get out on the field during a game and asked if I still played whether in gym basketball league or did local 5k races or anything like that. When I told said no and that I hadn't been going to the gym or going on runs for a years ,he laughed and shook his head.

He was almost giddy when he told me he'd bet his house that based on my lifestyle, all I needed to do was add a daily aerobic exercise routine back into my life. Make it 45 minutes a day a priority, if all possible. He explained the science of endorphin release afterwards and all that and then we talked about how crucial staying motivated to do it every day was.

So after years stuck in a pointless depression, on a 10 scale of 1 really depressed and 10 as always happy, I went from a 2-3 to a 5-6 in a about 6 weeks. It usually boosts to about an 8 for a couple hours directly after whatever exercise I do. The gym high is real.

I'll leave you with this: while this isn't possible for everyone and won't work for everyone, it is 100% worth a shot. If you've never done any training, start small. A 15 minute walk maybe. But do it everyday and gradually increase as you feel able. I promise over a relatively short period, you will feel SOMETHING. And hey if not, it's still good for your heart.

Whatever keeps you going, keep doing it.

,depression_help,"Hi, fellas. I will tell my history. I'm writing this at 4:46 AM on January 24, 2020. Well, I think all of this has began at early 2019. Before It all. I has to introduce myself right? My name...Well, I won't tell it. You can call me as you wish. Born early 2000s. I live in Brazil. Let's go. Like I said before, everything has start at all early 2019 (I guess). I start to imaginating me fucking with some people especially my nieces one is a kid and another a baby and I cumming on it. This impacted me...you now? Suicide. But this happen to another people why this impacted me? I imaginated me having a pee pee on my friend's girlfriend. Have a period of time that I imaginated people without their eyes. Actually has periods that I had fear of becoming blind. I don't if is because I have made jokes about a ""friend"" that have one eye blind. He have his moments of stupid speech but this don't justified what I have done. Have a time that I watched Gotham (2014) that Is a tv show. There is a Joker on the series, and for a period I wanted to be him, kill people you know? Why? Why? Why? Have a time in mid 2018 that I was in conflict religiously. I wanted to know that If god or satan really exist. I guess that I've prayed for my mom die? I've prayed to rain? For both? You know now I'm in conflict with the numbers 12 and 18.  My nieces have been born in years that ends there. I don't know what to do. I am racist? I can't have a relationship with women. Well, once I was masturbating and when I was going to thought the name of my niece. Once I was watching porn and remembered of the name of father of my friend. It happens with one of nieces too. I think it's because the father of my friend will become our neighbor (I guess) And I have interect with my niece then this happens. And I always hated to interect with children. And this had happens. I start to hate recently my family. Seems like that the universe want me to die. I had for a period bipolarity once I was happy then sad. I have social anxiety. My life sucks. And I'm only 17. Seems like nothing is real. Some days ago I've dreamed that I was fucking with my mother. This is because that have porn video that have this genre. I start to believe that I would live a 2nd life because I want to be happy but I can't anymore. I must believe that this is a disease/mental illness because If it won't means that... I don't know actually what that means. Help me please. I'm afraid of taking a bus to search for work and lost my self. I read something I think I'm dumb and must die. Well on 5th grade I hit my self with books then... I thought I'll kill myself with overdose. But now any way must work. And more and more world goes crazy I thought kill myself is the best. I f you could help, I'll be grateful. You know what happens with guys like me on prision i saying about what ive imaginated. If you could help, I'll be grateful. I thought if i was in prision i would kill a police guard and laugh just to the others dont hurt me. People says, ""Death shouldn't have to be an option"", read this fucking history about me. Do you think that I have a chance? The shame of having a mental illness unknown, is bigger than me. If you could help, I'll be grateful. Ps: i've written this on my smartphone on my bed. I don't know why I've said this (PS) The imaginations has happen equal to animals, dog. I don't know why but i like me doing cool things, i imaginated me likle satan, lucifer, king of hell, prince.

I constantly think about reality and the experienced/observer of it, and briefly had night terror episodes where I’d have this intense pressure in my right ear and wouldn’t be able to move and I’d float out of my body. Sometimes, I have these panic attacks where I know I’m about to think about the unsolvable questions and I can’t stop it. I want to go back to the way I was, I didn’t know that this would happen to me. I’m fine on the outside and manage these things well, but I have no idea if I’ve forsaken myself forever. Thinking about all of these deep questions hurts me. Love any advice from anyone, I know I’m not alone, but whenever these thoughts and weirdness happen, I feel very isolated and everyone seems fake/asleep&lt;/p&gt;

I never wanted to burden people with my problems. I convinced myself I was just sad. Everyone gets sad right?

,depression_help,"Hi everyone.
I am new to Reddit. I see my boyfriend use it often, so I figured I'd give it a try to find a sense of community and potentially find some help...
Quick background about myself: I am a 20 year old female... full time college student in STEM. I am on the pre-med track and hope to one day become a physician. I would consider myself to be a bubbly and sweet person on the outside, but I've struggled mentally for nearly my entire life. I went through some pretty rough trauma throughout my childhood as a result of verbal/physical/mental abuse from my mother and losing my father to cancer at 16. I always felt like it was a ""normal"" way to live and built up a lot of stress and anxiety. I grasped control over school/grades because it was the only sense of ""stability"" I could find in my life, and after moving away to college, my depression/anxiety started to catch up with my physical and mental health. I have been in and out of doctor's offices/hospitals for panic attacks/tachycardia, digestive issues (polyps and potentially ulcers), chronic headaches, etc.)
Update to now: Over the summer, I was going to the emergency rooms often for extremely high heart rates/blood pressure as a result of panic attacks. My depression and anxiety reached an all time high, and I decided it was time to get help. I have been in counselling for close to 6 months now, and I have been prescribed 40 mg of CeleXa and 30 mg of Vyvanse (in hopes of curbing mild/moderate BED as a result of depression)... I spent a lot of time in survival mode and eventually worked myself up to attend yoga every day, eat out slightly less, spend less time in bed, and attempt to get things accomplished. For the past few weeks, I feel like everything is just going in reverse. I often find myself in bed... I often find myself with insane cravings for random foods to fix my sadness... I want to cry and can't find the energy to do anything. I know it's a cycle and recovery isn't just a straight upwards trend... but it feels so disheartening when I am finally feeling better and then things crash and burn again. I was starting to lose weight and feel more confident... spend more time studying... eating better... etc. I know that I can't go from nothing to everything without burning myself out, but I also don't know why I can't just feel better. Does anyone have any suggestions or tactics?

I would consider myself to be a bubbly and sweet person on the outside, but I&amp;#39;ve struggled mentally for nearly my entire life. I went through some pretty rough trauma throughout my childhood as a result of verbal/physical/mental abuse from my mother and losing my father to cancer at 16. I always felt like it was a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; way to live and built up a lot of stress and anxiety. I grasped control over school/grades because it was the only sense of &amp;quot;stability&amp;quot; I could find in my life, and after moving away to college, my depression/anxiety started to catch up with my physical and mental health. I have been in and out of doctor&amp;#39;s offices/hospitals for panic attacks/tachycardia, digestive issues (polyps and potentially ulcers), chronic headaches, etc.)
Update to now: Over the summer, I was going to the emergency rooms often for extremely high heart rates/blood pressure as a result of panic attacks. My depression and anxiety reached an all time high, and I decided it was time to get help. I have been in counselling for close to 6 months now, and I have been prescribed 40 mg of CeleXa and 30 mg of Vyvanse (in hopes of curbing mild/moderate BED as a result of depression)... I spent a lot of time in survival mode and eventually worked myself up to attend yoga every day, eat out slightly less, spend less time in bed, and attempt to get things accomplished. For the past few weeks, I feel like everything is just going in reverse. I often find myself in bed... I often find myself with insane cravings for random foods to fix my sadness... I want to cry and can&amp;#39;t find the energy to do anything. I know it&amp;#39;s a cycle and recovery isn&amp;#39;t just a straight upwards trend... but it feels so disheartening when I am finally feeling better and then things crash and burn again. I was starting to lose weight and feel more confident... spend more time studying... eating better... etc. I know that I can&amp;#39;t go from nothing to everything without burning myself out, but I also don&amp;#39;t know why I can&amp;#39;t just feel better. Does anyone have any suggestions or tactics? I am so sorry for the long post... idk if it belongs in a different reddit!&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, and/or people against men being allowed to be feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I can't even use that, since the type of movies and shows I'm interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&amp;#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

&amp;#x200B;

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better.

,depression_help,"Hello guys,  


It must be like three days that I'm registered on Reddit (sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isn't my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, that's not a problem I hope) and I was trying to give an advice to ""people"" like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday.  


My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that I've got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said (the advice) because in her case (which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didn't have to and whatever) and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it.  


The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didn't have to talk to me like that. I didn't knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, I've been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year (one time could be hours, days, weeks or months) of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And I'm even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help. It might not always work or be the better thing to do in some situations or for some people but I cannot know everybody's lives and everyone's situation and as a highly sensitive person too, I am ALWAYS trying to write/speak in the way of not trying to hurt anyone, to be as kind as possible (I am a kind person actually, so I try to be it even if I feel like I just want to die) and so on.  


I was feeling like a total mess last night because of the comments of this girl, because she was really telling me that I was like kind of guilty of giving not any advice but like, I was helping people to get killed in some way. She did not actually say that but I really take it badly and I still feel like, because of what she told me (a total stranger, yes) I treated myself like I was right to believe that I should kill myself because I was just a piece of shit to the world and because I was angry too and really bad, at a moment, by brother tried to told me a joke that wasn't funny and I just talked to him really really badly so he got the impression that I didn't even deserved to be talked to and left. To some point, I've been crying for hours, feeling suicidal, and even went to my mom who just told me to stay away from internet (yes at that point, but it was just some girl on reddit but, still) and I felt terrible because I don't have any real good support anywhere in real life.  


I don't even know why I am posting that, I guess I need it out of my chest, and was in research of kind words, and good people. I don't know if anyone would even comment or saw my post, but well. Even if I don't have a plan to kill myself and don't want any of course, I feel like I should die and I am so tired of feeling this way. I know I don't deserve that because I am a kind person and a loving person who cares a lot. I tried to post this on another sub but while I was writing, I guess I just should post it here. I don't know if I have done the best thing, but I have to go, so I guess I will see in the day if anyone would have answer me.

,depression_help,"hi. i am 17 and i feel truly helpless about my life. ive been having severe depression on and off for about a year (the last 3 or 4 months consistently severe) and before that my episodes varied in range but rarely ever had any gaps between them. this has been going on since about 13, getting worse over time.

last year my two siblings moved out on their own terms (we have an abusive father and parents have a toxic falling in-and-out relationship) and after years of my father denying going to therapy or getting help, he finally decided to let us (me and my parents) see a counsellor.

i have been going to counselling for a year already and me and my counsellor both have made many pleas about taking me to a psychiatrist for my depression and anxiety. my parents said no.

they don't want me to SEE if i need help, they don't want me to have any option at all to be diagnosed, because of the possibility of getting medication. as much as both me and my counsellor have explained the misconceptions and logistics of prescription antidepressants, my mother still says she won't let me go see a psychiatrist.

i started cbt a few months ago because my mother is convinced that i can simply use cbt to overcome my issues, and that medication wouldn't help, and wants me to ""try it out first"" like i can just pick either. the problem is, i struggle to follow the workbook or the application of learned tools when my body is physically off and tired, i'm procrastinatory and moody, etc. which i can't really snap out of just by ""willing myself"" to.

(this is because with severe depression, you usually need combination treatment to tackle it.)

i'm not sure what to do.

i want to ask again to see if i can at least try some natural supplements (st. john's wort, higher doses of L-theanine? [i have taken some before but not consistently / for depression, only during anxiety spirals / attacks] ) but i am afraid of even bringing it up.



the main thing i want to know is:



would i be able to get antidepressants by myself at this age? i can't get a prescription currently. are there ways to get prozac or zoloft online? are there over the counter antidepressants that i can get without prescription that will do the job? genuinely looking for answers..google isn't my best friend here.

&lt;p&gt;last year my two siblings moved out on their own terms (we have an abusive father and parents have a toxic falling in-and-out relationship) and after years of my father denying going to therapy or getting help, he finally decided to let us (me and my parents) see a counsellor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i have been going to counselling for a year already and me and my counsellor both have made many pleas about taking me to a psychiatrist for my depression and anxiety. my parents said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they don&amp;#39;t want me to SEE if i need help, they don&amp;#39;t want me to have any option at all to be diagnosed, because of the possibility of getting medication. as much as both me and my counsellor have explained the misconceptions and logistics of prescription antidepressants, my mother still says she won&amp;#39;t let me go see a psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started cbt a few months ago because my mother is convinced that i can simply use cbt to overcome my issues, and that medication wouldn&amp;#39;t help, and wants me to &amp;quot;try it out first&amp;quot; like i can just pick either. the problem is, i struggle to follow the workbook or the application of learned tools when my body is physically off and tired, i&amp;#39;m procrastinatory and moody, etc. which i can&amp;#39;t really snap out of just by &amp;quot;willing myself&amp;quot; to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(this is because with severe depression, you usually need combination treatment to tackle it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m not sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to ask again to see if i can at least try some natural supplements (st. john&amp;#39;s wort, higher doses of L-theanine? [i have taken some before but not consistently / for depression, only during anxiety spirals / attacks] ) but i am afraid of even bringing it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the main thing i want to know is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would i be able to get antidepressants by myself at this age? i can&amp;#39;t get a prescription currently. are there ways to get prozac or zoloft online? are there over the counter antidepressants that i can get without prescription that will do the job? genuinely looking for answers..google isn&amp;#39;t my best friend here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i can&amp;#39;t handle my depression anymore. please let me know your experiences and what you think i should do. i just wanna go about this the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"This is going to be long but I appreciate any responses and suggestions whether nice or harsh.

I met a girl from out of state while vising a friend. We hit it off really well and it looked like she was into me and I was very into her.

After I left we spoke and texted each other daily. Things seemed perfect until she disappeared without an  explanation. A few month later she said that she is going to visit my area (her family lives there) and she would really like to see me. When I saw her she apologized for what she did. She was in a terrible relationship before and she was scared of going through what she's been to. In the next few days a purchased a plane ticket to go see her for Christmas.

I came to visit her for Christmas. We had a great time. She knows a lot of people in that small town and literally half the town knew who I was. She told everyone about me. The night before I was about to leave we got into a giant argument which did not make any sense to me at the time. By the end of the argument I learned that she was angry because she didn't know how to deal with the fact that I was leaving. In the end I felt that the argument was totally worth it and it made me realize how much she actually loves me. 

Since I left we have been texting and talking on the daily basis until just recently.

Now here is where depression comes into play... I'm depressed, lost, scared and insecure. I was in a relationship before that lasted for about 8 years. It involved drugs, cheating, threats of suicide and suicide attempts, physical violence (on her side), me questioning my every move and apologizing for things I should not have to.

I feel like that relationship is affecting my new relationship with that new girl. I'm scared to say something because I feel that everything I say is pointless and stupid. She is a very strong woman and I feel like a broken mess. I'm terrified. I do have a ticket to go see her again very soon but I just can't stop thinking. I'm depressed and insecure and most likely for no reason what so ever.

Our communication has cut down drastically and I feel that it's my fault. I don't know what to say without overthinking and my mind goes blank when I speak to her.

I think all these insecurities and terrible thoughts are the reason for the lack of communication. I'm a mess. I can't stop thinking. I want to have an amazing conversation with her and I would like to spend an hour taking to her but I have nothing say. Well..  I have a lot to say but not when it matters. I don't know what to do. I want her to understand that I'm going through stuff and I will do my best to get past all that but what if it turns out to be a lie and I'll be just as miserable as ever. Maybe there is no hope for me. I do text her more often than she replies and it drives me crazy. That being said I'm not texting her non stop. Just here and there. Also, when she does reply she says she misses me and asks about my day but I can't stop feeling like I'm being overbearing.

Let me know if clarification needed if you've gotten this far haha. Thanks. I'm depressed, lonely, bitter, scared, lonely and angry and sometimes I wonder if the next life will have something better to offer.

I've been lonely for way too long (even with that 8 year relationship). There was no love there.

There is so much more... Feel free to dm me and I'll spill my guts out to you if you're interested and/or experienced something similar or ask here if you'd like.

 Any comment will do. I'm not expecting a major breakthrough that'll change my life forever. Just thoughts or if anyone else experienced anything even remotely similar to this. If so, if like to hear about it.

There may be a typo here somewhere or something that isn't clear. Let me know where and I'll explain.

Please excuse my absurd rant, but I feel like venting online is oddly therapeutic.

Currently, my perfectionism has ruined everything. I’m never satisfied with any of my academic work. When I get consistent A’s, I feel as if it’s simply my responsibility. If I don’t get A’s, I obviously feel like a complete,utter failure and a disgusting insect of a human being. 

Everything was “fine”, I was pushing all of my emotions to the back of my head until now. My high school midterms went  incredibly smooth, but after that I couldn’t help but feel suicidal. I’ve realised that I’m not satisfied with anything, and that I can’t keep succeeding for the rest of my life. I’ve always dealt with some sort of mental ailment (from extreme anxiety disorder, to bulimia, depression, anorexia, etc) so that only fuels my relentless thoughts.

The fact that I’m quite young also feeds into my suicidal thoughts, since this is supposed to be the “easiest” part of my life. I was close to killing myself, I even had it all planned out! Who knows if I was brave enough to actually do it, but I had a note and everything.

The only thing that stopped me was my mother, since I couldn’t possibly throw my life away after all her years of sacrifices;not while living under her roof. I’m seeking help now, and I’ve been getting evaluated for mental disorders, and will possibly get medication. Even my psychologist agrees that my perfectionism could very likely be the root of most (if not all) of my emotional distress.

My question is, does anyone else feel like this? Perfectionism is an awful curse! I feel nauseated writing this since I’m supposed to be studying for 2 tests, but my depression has made it physically impossible for me to concentrate or study. I absolutely abhor making mistakes, and I can’t help but feel my crushing expectations piling above me, and weighing my down like a sack of bricks.

I have a great husband and a really tight circle of friends, all of whom know and understand my struggles either from personal experience with depression themselves, or from being there to help me out of particularly bad funks in the past. 

Recently, I've been using snapchat to stay in touch with all of them (my husband and I moved a few states away a few years ago for college, but are planning to move back this summer). I'll send them a message on snap and it'll be marked as ""seen"" but they won't reply for a while, or sometimes not at all. Sometimes I snap them four or five times a week, which I know can be a little clingy, so I understand not responding all the time. Usually it's something silly I come across during the day, or something that doesn't necessarily warrant a response. Our communications are the same as they've always been, which is what makes me question if anything is actually wrong. 

In my head, I'm either being too clingy or not reaching out to them enough. When they don't respond, I have horrible anxiety and wonder if I've done something wrong, or I'll start to suspect that they're finally getting tired of me and wish I would just leave them alone. I can't tell if that's my depression talking, or if they really are getting sick of me. I don't want to outright ask them, because I'm afraid I'm being to clingy and needy as is.

,depression_help,"Disclaimer: I'm posting this for a friend who wishes to be anonymous. I'm pasting it exactly as he wrote it.
It's a long story.

--

A little background before I tell the story.
My girlfriend and I posted it anonymously as a reply on quora, and somehow a few people correctly guessed who we are. 

Now, the story.

Yours before we met, my girlfriend was in a serious accident and is unable to have children.. One of her biggest dreams.
This resulted in a depression that she's been struggling with ever since.

Over a year ago she read a question on quora that peeked her interest, and she asked me if I'd allow her to do some things.
My biggest wish is for her to be happy, so I agreed.

We'd already agreed on the day, and I was to do nothing at all on my own. Not even move or talk. She is in absolute control.
I'm approximately half a head taller than her, but really slim. And she's at least 10 times stronger than me.. This is important for some of the following to make sense. 
This is going to be very detailed! It's also to sound really weird to many people. 

Here is what happened the following Saturday.
She woke me up with breakfast in bed and fed me before picking me up and carrying me to the bathroom to bathe me very thoroughly (and gently)
After drying me, she dressed me up as a doll.. Complete with makeup and a pink bow in my hair.
Throughout the day, she took perfect care of me. Even the simplest things like going to the toilet, washing my hands, brushing my teeth.. She took care of everything. 

I admit, it was weird. I felt uncomfortable about some of the things at the time, but I also noticed how relaxed she was. And I saw a subtle smile and the look in her eyes. 

She played with me like a doll, and by the end of the day I actually didn't want it to stop. 
I slept in a guest bed that night (a stand-in for a doll bed), being tucked in tightly and kissed goodnight. 

We talked about it in the morning, and we agreed to try it again next weekend.. 
She went out and bought lots of cute outfits in my size, really looking forward to it. 

Since then, I've been many different kinds of toys (always toys.. We never even discussed anything else. And I'd have refused to be a child) 
Dolls, teddy bears, action figures. 

This has never even remotely been of any kind of sexual nature. 

Just seeing how this has changed her life and made her happy makes it worth it. But honestly, I've started looking forward to it more because of the amazing feeling of having her complete, undivided attention every weekend. Saturday and Sunday. 
Her therapist has also taken an interest in this, and is extremely impressed.. Calling me a hero (I'm not. I just want the love of my life to be happy) 

Now on to the problem. 
A few days after I posted the story, a few friends at work came up to me and asked if I was okay (?) 
I responded that, yes. Why wouldn't I be? 
They looked really concerned and I noticed them talking to others, looking over at me from time to time. 

I was called in to my supervisor's office later, and she started asking about my wellbeing. She told me that she'd heard about the story. And she'd be happy to help me.
She'd dealt with abuse before, and I was obviously in distress.

Too many people know about this now. And it's come to the point where police shows up at our door due to reports of domestic abuse.
My girlfriend (fiancé) is badly affected by this, and her depression is worse than ever. She's also no longer comfortable continuing this.

I've started telling everyone to stay away from us (our family is completely supportive of us. They didn't know, but they've seen the change she's gone through)
I'm about to get terminated from my job because ""I'm causing a hostile environment"" and generally being rude to people who are just ""trying to save me"" from my ""abusive girlfriend""

I feel like I'm justified in cutting ties with everyone involved, as well as telling them to f off.. They've pretty much ruined our lives, and I'm not sure if this situation can even be fixed at this point.

I was nearly arrested last night for screaming at a couple of ""concerned citizens"" in a restaurant to mind their own business.

I'm considering legal action against the involved parties.
Also.. I don’t know what to do anymore :(",t2_4ej6tapp,False,,0,False,How we dealt with depression..

&lt;p&gt;Just seeing how this has changed her life and made her happy makes it worth it. But honestly, I&amp;#39;ve started looking forward to it more because of the amazing feeling of having her complete, undivided attention every weekend. Saturday and Sunday. 
Her therapist has also taken an interest in this, and is extremely impressed.. Calling me a hero (I&amp;#39;m not. I just want the love of my life to be happy) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on to the problem. 
A few days after I posted the story, a few friends at work came up to me and asked if I was okay (?) 
I responded that, yes. Why wouldn&amp;#39;t I be? 
They looked really concerned and I noticed them talking to others, looking over at me from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was called in to my supervisor&amp;#39;s office later, and she started asking about my wellbeing. She told me that she&amp;#39;d heard about the story. And she&amp;#39;d be happy to help me.
She&amp;#39;d dealt with abuse before, and I was obviously in distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many people know about this now. And it&amp;#39;s come to the point where police shows up at our door due to reports of domestic abuse.
My girlfriend (fiancé) is badly affected by this, and her depression is worse than ever. She&amp;#39;s also no longer comfortable continuing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started telling everyone to stay away from us (our family is completely supportive of us. They didn&amp;#39;t know, but they&amp;#39;ve seen the change she&amp;#39;s gone through)
I&amp;#39;m about to get terminated from my job because &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m causing a hostile environment&amp;quot; and generally being rude to people who are just &amp;quot;trying to save me&amp;quot; from my &amp;quot;abusive girlfriend&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m justified in cutting ties with everyone involved, as well as telling them to f off.. They&amp;#39;ve pretty much ruined our lives, and I&amp;#39;m not sure if this situation can even be fixed at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was nearly arrested last night for screaming at a couple of &amp;quot;concerned citizens&amp;quot; in a restaurant to mind their own business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering legal action against the involved parties.
Also.. I don’t know what to do anymore :(&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"So just a little back story: I started working part time when I was 15 (I’m 20 now) then worked two jobs every day when I was 16-17 I always had a really great work ethic and loved my jobs, I’ve been in the same job from 17- July 2019 I quit after a few employees sent me into 3 emotional breakdowns in the run of a week, and I’ve since been “unemployed”

I use quotations because I hit a job sometime around august but I had to get my LLQP (life license qualification program) for the job position, so I did that and finished sometime September maybe early October and I’ve been in training ever since, still with no solid income since July 2019. I have everything done to start making money but I have no desire to continue learning my script, I’ve been severely depressed since like 12yrs old but I always managed to separate it from work and never let it get in the way until now, for months I’ve been unable to shake my uncontrollable desire to wallow in sadness over not being able to get out of bed INSTEAD of doing something about it.

,depression_help,"Before today, I didn't even know or even seriously consider that I may be depressed. To me it just seemed normal, and probably due to the gradual increase of the severity I simply didn't connect the dots.

From what I can recall it's been going on since I was around 12, back in 2014. First I remember becoming quite lazy and finding getting anything done an incredibly hard challenge. I thought it was just because I was a teenager, and lazyness is a normal teenager status. Then I started having a lot of anger issues, I'd get pissed off for the most minute things, I had an incredibly short fuse but I just thought it was also normal teenager behavior. Eventually I managed to suppress those explosions so they'd go off in my head but no one would notice. I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy a lot, like math, and went from reading 30 books a year to reading 0 last year.

I think I was around 15 when the first suicidal thought occurred. Every time I'd fuck up and get grounded or yelled at, or faced consequences for my actions I'd just think over and over again that I wasn't worth anything. Those thoughts disappeared for some time, but arose back last year. I, again, thought it was normal. I think the reason they stopped is because I was at a relative high in my life, I had entered college at 16 years of age and everyone I knew was proud of me, and I felt good about myself. Or so I think I thought.

I feel like I can speak for any teenager out there that mastubating is normal. Yet I'm not sure when, it became a daily thing, and then 2 or 3 times per day. Also I stopped showering, I don't even know why. I just didn't. I'd go into the bathroom, turn on the water and just sit on the toilet looking at it or my phone. I stopped cleaning my room and then stopped washing my clothes. I'd wait till the last pair of underwear, maybe reuse it a few times and then wash enough clothes for a week, while months of clothes were piled up. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while. Not sure if it's got anything to do with this but I started driving really aggressively, well past the speed limit even after a ticket, something I didn't do when I got my license. Lastly, I've always been very thin, as a male I still weighed around 120lbs ish. Now I'm around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I don't think I'm fat or anything like that, but I'd never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months. All of this paragraph started around the same time.

Today I was talking to a friend of mine over the phone and for some reason he just asked me: ""are you depressed?"" Which left me thinking, yet my college classes distracted me for enough time. Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, it's then that I realized I haven't showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while.

I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than I've cried in years. I read all about ""seek help"" and ""tell your parents about it"" but I'm kind of ashamed to admit it. They've given everything to provide for me and my sister, and I've got all the ingredients for what I'd assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when there's people who have it much worse than me.

Im posting it here because I need anonymous support. I'm not yet ready to admit it out loud,but I think I'm depressed.

,depression_help,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ♥",t2_2x0x085x,False,,0,False,Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'PROVIDING SUPPORT'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_erxx2i,False,dark,,public,120,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},PROVIDING SUPPORT,False,120,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579656443.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context I&amp;#39;m a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I&amp;#39;m currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I&amp;#39;ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you&amp;#39;re willing to fight for yourself.

,depression_help,"Hello,
Sorry if this post isn't structured or organized or anything, posting here very spontaneous

,depression_help," ***Disclaimer: I’m writing this after just waking up at 10pm after three hours of sleep, before a cup of tea and my toast has gone cold already, so there will be a lot of tangents and discordance in what I write.***

Depression can be experienced differently and uniquely by each person, but overall there are some things that everyone who suffers with it can relate to and understand, no matter what end of the scale you’re on. It seldom comes alone, usually paired with anxiety of some kind, BPD, OCD or something like insomnia.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ll give you an example of how it’s hit me today, I’ve spent the past few days around people I love and care about more than I can put into words here, with a lot of laughter and love - yet I’ve been feeling *off*. Slept okay, eaten well, generally been happy. But I have that sinking feeling, I had all day long to play video games, watch films and essentially do what I please, but I didn’t have any energy, any focus, or any want - I wanted to *want* to do those things. I even tried, but half an hour later and I couldn’t manage it. I felt so drained. For no logical reason, I hadn’t done a workout, I’d managed 6 hours sleep and I was hydrated and had nothing in my mind bothering me.

I fell asleep about two hours later at 7pm after going for a walk with music to try and clear my mind and get some fresh air for a second wind to carry me through the evening until bed, but it didn’t really help, I still felt awful. Woke up around 10pm, tried to force myself back to sleep so I wasn’t out of sync, but here I am, writing and adding to this essay at half past midnight.

Of all the things that I could be bothered by with depression, mentioned mostly above, what really cripples me about it is the fact that it changes who I am. By this, I mean that usually, I’m quite jovial, I’m sarcastic, witty, laugh about it all kind of person, but when I feel like I do now, it’s hard to crack a joke, or to think of one. It’s tough to laugh at the banterous insults that we usually throw at one another which all mean “I love you”.

The worst part of this change is that people think that you’re mad at them, that they’ve done something and it’s their fault. That because you aren’t all smiles and you’ve put headphones on, in an effort to listen to music and regain some balance, that you’re trying to drown them out or ignore them when you aren’t, when it’s actually because you need music to chill but you don’t want to force them to listen to it because your music tastes differ.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the time on social media, there’s posts and memes and that sorta stuff where it’s referenced in either a super serious way, trying to raise awareness, or as many do, use the jokes as a coping mechanism so you don’t cry yourself into a hot mess about your problems. Most of the time when I see these posts and memes, my only interaction is to like it and if it’s a good meme; save it. Seldom do I comment or contribute in any fashion - unless it’s a friend in need.

So this suggests that we do in fact share common attributes of depression and I’m sure if you want to get technical, then that’s why it’s becoming more recognised and diagnosable in people. But there’s nothing better when going through some of the horrible experiences and illnesses to know that you aren’t the only one who is dealing with it, or has made it out the other side of it.

&amp;#x200B;

For now I can’t recall exactly who, my mind is telling me it’s Russell Howard, but he makes a point about how “stress” is simply a rebrand of the word “unhappy” and he gives examples.

“I’m stressed out about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general”, would be something you’d say and we all accept that’s the way life is and there’s not much to be done about it, but if you said “I’m *unhappy* about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general”, we try to do something about it because we don’t want to be unhappy. Because being stressed has become the norm and being unhappy is okay in part, but not as a continuous feeling.

This makes a ton of sense to me, it really spoke to me and connected some of the dots. I was about thirteen when I first started suffering from insomnia and depression, now at the time I didn’t realise that’s what it was really, in my mind, I was just sad about being a fat kid, rarely fitting in (no pun intended) and I would get bored of not falling asleep at night - so I’d play video games and eventually fell for the nonsense that it was the screen keeping me up.

To clarify, I am aware about bluelight and trouble games etc cause with sleeplessness so to make it crystal clear, I was struggling to fall asleep with nothing going on, until approx 3-4am when I’d then get bored and get up since school was only a few hours away. There’s a lot more that was happening in my life back then that looking back on it I was able to realise why I felt how I did etc, but I won’t go into that for personal reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few weeks ago, I attended a mental illness seminar for the benefit of someone else. 99% of what was discussed during the two hour event was stuff me and this other person had already known so it felt kinda useless going, but you go just in case that 1% helps. What **did** help was that the other people attending were exactly that; they were human. People looking for answers and where those leading the seminar couldn’t answer, others in the room chimed in with what worked for them etc.

You had realness, people opening up about themselves and loved ones instead of staying silent for fear of being different or embarrassed **AND IT WORKED**. You could feel everyone in the room relax and a few people looked like they wanted to cry because they realised themselves and their loved ones are not alone. After the event came to a close, a woman came straight over to me from another table because I’d spoken up about my insomnia when the topic of ‘how to use positive language’ or something like that:

I’d mentioned how suffering with insomnia and poor sleep patterns, ‘jokey’ phrases and greetings can quickly become commonplace and stick for a long time, which if you have thick skin and a good sense of humour can be brushed off, but even then it can bring you from bad to worse.

So I gave the example that, when you suffer with it, you can often miss daylight and all the usual 9-5 things in life that other people do on a daily basis - even just getting some shopping. Then there’s the fact that you begin to hate yourself. Another day wasted. You’ve still got to mentally prepare yourself for it all tomorrow and make sure you do it because you’re on day three with no food.

You have to settle yourself down in an hour in order to make sure you have enough energy to do tomorrow and reset your pattern. You haven't showered yet, if you do, it could wake you up and have you up all night again, but if you don’t it’s something else you have to do tomorrow before going anywhere.

It can all stem from just being out of sync for one day. That’s all it takes, one day. Going to bed early, or being unable to sleep at night and you can be stuck in a bad loop for days to weeks and breaking the cycle is tough. If you live with other people, you can’t do something engaging during the night to keep you awake, usually because it rarely comes with zero noise. Or because your parents say you can’t do it and you need to sleep. For me it’s anxiety that I’ll wake someone and I find sleep to be a precious thing, so I don’t want to deprive others of that.

By the time that the sun is up and people are shuffling about to go to work and go about their day, you’re totalled, spent and utterly shattered because you’ve done very little but be awake when you want to sleep. For me, energy drinks only do two things, they make me awake for 10 minutes and then hardcore crash, and they make me pee. Same goes for tea and coffee. So before you know it, when it’s 10am and you’re trying super hard to stay awake, you pass out and it’s 5pm and it all starts over again.

On some days, managing to get up at a decent time, do some morning hygiene and making it downstairs to see family; that can sometimes take every bit of power you can summon to achieve that and sometimes it’s too much. To then be greeted with “ah so you’ve decided to join the land of the living” or a similar level of sarcastic comment can completely wipe you out. “Why did I even bother...” is the first thought I tend to have, “...I should have just stayed in bed”.

So me and this woman got to chatting about what I went through and what I found worked for me or people I knew, and what touched me was that she was concerned for her daughter who was suffering big time and she was trying to find out what she could do to help. I gave her some pointers and spoke about what to avoid doing etc. If that is the **ONLY** thing that changed in the world from that seminar, then that’s a win to me.

That mother no longer has to feel alone or useless because she can’t make her daughter’s problem go away, because she doesn’t have the answers or tools to help and that is the most soul destroying thing as a parent, to know your kid is going through hell and you can’t help them. But she has something now, it might not work, but it’s a direction to go in and it’s a light in the dark.

I think it was Robin Williams who was credited with saying that depression is like being in a room full of people and feeling alone. A man of many faces who gave such joy to us on screen and who as most of you will know, sadly committed suicide a few years ago.

This is where I get heavily opinionated and I want to state that I am not going to suggest that the things I go on to mention will work for you, only that they are coping strategies and parts of my personality that have developed to help me deal with my mental load, stress and depression.

To open this segment, the most useful thing I learned was the ‘spoons’ metaphor. This comes in a couple of other variations I’ve heard of, such as ‘eggs in the box’ and ‘mana’ for the gamers.

Imagine you have a limited number of spoons per day, this number is not fixed and does not stay the same every day. It can change based on how well you slept, if you have eaten well, stayed hydrated, how much you did the day before or a traumatic event etc. Each task in a day, even the tiny ones, will use a certain number of your spoons up, and once you’ve used all the ones available to you, you’ll suffer tomorrow by borrowing spoons to do more.

I’ll happily detail an example in comments or do another detailed post if that helps, but I’m aware this post is reaching a ridiculous length. The main lesson to be drawn from it is that you have a limit you can do and that it changes each day and doing more than your limit will force you to borrow from tomorrow. This isn’t a set rule and lots of factors alter your numbers here, so it’s best to try and measure this yourself if you can - if that’s a struggle for you, I’ll help however I can.

The lesson taught me that it’s okay to say “I can’t do anymore today”, which is hard when you’re a perfectionist and you kick yourself for not doing what you expect of yourself and falling short of that standard. It taught me to prioritise things and to praise myself for achieving the smallest of things to others. I managed to shower today, that’s a win. Those dishes got done and I can eat now, that’s a win. It sounds **SUPER** demeaning at first if you’re cynically wired like me, but it works, it takes a little bit of pressure off.

Now this is all going to sound very tangential, I was talking about Robin Williams, spoons, where is this going? Please stay with me.

He was a man of many faces and the truth is we all are, most of us have three faces, we have a work face, a family and friends face and our own face. This won’t be news to most of you, but for those who do not know this I’ll explain.

Our work face is the mask we wear when we deal with everyone else in the outside world who isn’t a friend or family. It’s smiles and nice voice and reserved personality, but it takes a huge drain on your spoons. The family and friends face is a mask we wear when we socialise and spend quality time with those we love, we come out of our shell here, laugh, chill and have a good time sometimes, but we still aren’t transparent. Our own face is our true self, it doesn’t define who we are entirely, but when we take of those other masks, we are tired and can feel alone.

That’s the idea most of us stick to and I’m here to controversially say that it doesn’t have to be like that, because when I was in that mindset it became a trap. Admin, I beg of you to read what I have to say here and consider it before deciding on whether this stays or goes.

In my own life, not drawing from anyone else, articles, studies or ideology, this is not the way forward. You are not a sad person, you are a **person**, who experiences sadness. You are not a depressed person, you are a **person** suffering with depression. I am not one of these “you’ll get over it” types. I still suffer heavily with my depression, but I want to reassure you that you have a personality and it is not only comprised of depression.

My personality is a sarcastic, cynical, witty, tongue in cheek humour and laughter is the best medicine kind of guy. I spent years of my life using that as my mask. Thinking that I was still just this very sad and depressed person and that’s all I was. I would hold back from saying things I found funny because I was so anxious that people wouldn’t like me, that they’d be offended or find me odd and weird. But that **IS** me, I am weird, I am odd, I am funny (my friends and family will scoff at that), I am all of those things and that’s okay. You’re allowed to be those things.

In fact, I wouldn’t want to be anyone else. I spent years trying so damn hard to be likeable and to be normal and fit in. It made me so unhappy and stressed and anxious and I could never be me. Bit by bit in my life I’ve stepped away from it. I’ve done what I wanted to do and say what I wanted to say and put myself and my interests first and it has done wonders for me. I’ve not become selfish and ignorant, because there is a balance. But instead of putting myself last, I’ve put myself not last.

And the friends and family I love and who love me, I know that they are under no illusion of who I am and what I go through. I trust them to call me out on things, and I’d do the same for them. It has helped rid me of the anxiety of people saying they care about me and being friends with me when the do not know me. If you can be true to who you are, the things you like and find passion in, you’ll find people who will like and love you for who you are - and those who decide that who you are, is reason to stop being a part of your life, are not people you want to be around.

All of the stuff I’ve mentioned above that is controversial and heavily opinionated is not gospel, please do not think that this is the answer or the only way forward. I encourage you to find strength in believing in yourself and trying to accept who you are. I still have my off days too, days I wake up and hate myself for my faults, but I know I have them, they are a part of me I want to change and I try to work on them, and that’s enough to be proud of.

YOU are allowed to be you.

&lt;p&gt;I’d mentioned how suffering with insomnia and poor sleep patterns, ‘jokey’ phrases and greetings can quickly become commonplace and stick for a long time, which if you have thick skin and a good sense of humour can be brushed off, but even then it can bring you from bad to worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I gave the example that, when you suffer with it, you can often miss daylight and all the usual 9-5 things in life that other people do on a daily basis - even just getting some shopping. Then there’s the fact that you begin to hate yourself. Another day wasted. You’ve still got to mentally prepare yourself for it all tomorrow and make sure you do it because you’re on day three with no food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to settle yourself down in an hour in order to make sure you have enough energy to do tomorrow and reset your pattern. You haven&amp;#39;t showered yet, if you do, it could wake you up and have you up all night again, but if you don’t it’s something else you have to do tomorrow before going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can all stem from just being out of sync for one day. That’s all it takes, one day. Going to bed early, or being unable to sleep at night and you can be stuck in a bad loop for days to weeks and breaking the cycle is tough. If you live with other people, you can’t do something engaging during the night to keep you awake, usually because it rarely comes with zero noise. Or because your parents say you can’t do it and you need to sleep. For me it’s anxiety that I’ll wake someone and I find sleep to be a precious thing, so I don’t want to deprive others of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time that the sun is up and people are shuffling about to go to work and go about their day, you’re totalled, spent and utterly shattered because you’ve done very little but be awake when you want to sleep. For me, energy drinks only do two things, they make me awake for 10 minutes and then hardcore crash, and they make me pee. Same goes for tea and coffee. So before you know it, when it’s 10am and you’re trying super hard to stay awake, you pass out and it’s 5pm and it all starts over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some days, managing to get up at a decent time, do some morning hygiene and making it downstairs to see family; that can sometimes take every bit of power you can summon to achieve that and sometimes it’s too much. To then be greeted with “ah so you’ve decided to join the land of the living” or a similar level of sarcastic comment can completely wipe you out. “Why did I even bother...” is the first thought I tend to have, “...I should have just stayed in bed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So me and this woman got to chatting about what I went through and what I found worked for me or people I knew, and what touched me was that she was concerned for her daughter who was suffering big time and she was trying to find out what she could do to help. I gave her some pointers and spoke about what to avoid doing etc. If that is the &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; thing that changed in the world from that seminar, then that’s a win to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That mother no longer has to feel alone or useless because she can’t make her daughter’s problem go away, because she doesn’t have the answers or tools to help and that is the most soul destroying thing as a parent, to know your kid is going through hell and you can’t help them. But she has something now, it might not work, but it’s a direction to go in and it’s a light in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was Robin Williams who was credited with saying that depression is like being in a room full of people and feeling alone. A man of many faces who gave such joy to us on screen and who as most of you will know, sadly committed suicide a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I get heavily opinionated and I want to state that I am not going to suggest that the things I go on to mention will work for you, only that they are coping strategies and parts of my personality that have developed to help me deal with my mental load, stress and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To open this segment, the most useful thing I learned was the ‘spoons’ metaphor. This comes in a couple of other variations I’ve heard of, such as ‘eggs in the box’ and ‘mana’ for the gamers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a limited number of spoons per day, this number is not fixed and does not stay the same every day. It can change based on how well you slept, if you have eaten well, stayed hydrated, how much you did the day before or a traumatic event etc. Each task in a day, even the tiny ones, will use a certain number of your spoons up, and once you’ve used all the ones available to you, you’ll suffer tomorrow by borrowing spoons to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll happily detail an example in comments or do another detailed post if that helps, but I’m aware this post is reaching a ridiculous length. The main lesson to be drawn from it is that you have a limit you can do and that it changes each day and doing more than your limit will force you to borrow from tomorrow. This isn’t a set rule and lots of factors alter your numbers here, so it’s best to try and measure this yourself if you can - if that’s a struggle for you, I’ll help however I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson taught me that it’s okay to say “I can’t do anymore today”, which is hard when you’re a perfectionist and you kick yourself for not doing what you expect of yourself and falling short of that standard. It taught me to prioritise things and to praise myself for achieving the smallest of things to others. I managed to shower today, that’s a win. Those dishes got done and I can eat now, that’s a win. It sounds &lt;strong&gt;SUPER&lt;/strong&gt; demeaning at first if you’re cynically wired like me, but it works, it takes a little bit of pressure off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is all going to sound very tangential, I was talking about Robin Williams, spoons, where is this going? Please stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a man of many faces and the truth is we all are, most of us have three faces, we have a work face, a family and friends face and our own face. This won’t be news to most of you, but for those who do not know this I’ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work face is the mask we wear when we deal with everyone else in the outside world who isn’t a friend or family. It’s smiles and nice voice and reserved personality, but it takes a huge drain on your spoons. The family and friends face is a mask we wear when we socialise and spend quality time with those we love, we come out of our shell here, laugh, chill and have a good time sometimes, but we still aren’t transparent. Our own face is our true self, it doesn’t define who we are entirely, but when we take of those other masks, we are tired and can feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea most of us stick to and I’m here to controversially say that it doesn’t have to be like that, because when I was in that mindset it became a trap. Admin, I beg of you to read what I have to say here and consider it before deciding on whether this stays or goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own life, not drawing from anyone else, articles, studies or ideology, this is not the way forward. You are not a sad person, you are a &lt;strong&gt;person&lt;/strong&gt;, who experiences sadness. You are not a depressed person, you are a &lt;strong&gt;person&lt;/strong&gt; suffering with depression. I am not one of these “you’ll get over it” types. I still suffer heavily with my depression, but I want to reassure you that you have a personality and it is not only comprised of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personality is a sarcastic, cynical, witty, tongue in cheek humour and laughter is the best medicine kind of guy. I spent years of my life using that as my mask. Thinking that I was still just this very sad and depressed person and that’s all I was. I would hold back from saying things I found funny because I was so anxious that people wouldn’t like me, that they’d be offended or find me odd and weird. But that &lt;strong&gt;IS&lt;/strong&gt; me, I am weird, I am odd, I am funny (my friends and family will scoff at that), I am all of those things and that’s okay. You’re allowed to be those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I wouldn’t want to be anyone else. I spent years trying so damn hard to be likeable and to be normal and fit in. It made me so unhappy and stressed and anxious and I could never be me. Bit by bit in my life I’ve stepped away from it. I’ve done what I wanted to do and say what I wanted to say and put myself and my interests first and it has done wonders for me. I’ve not become selfish and ignorant, because there is a balance. But instead of putting myself last, I’ve put myself not last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the friends and family I love and who love me, I know that they are under no illusion of who I am and what I go through. I trust them to call me out on things, and I’d do the same for them. It has helped rid me of the anxiety of people saying they care about me and being friends with me when the do not know me. If you can be true to who you are, the things you like and find passion in, you’ll find people who will like and love you for who you are - and those who decide that who you are, is reason to stop being a part of your life, are not people you want to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stuff I’ve mentioned above that is controversial and heavily opinionated is not gospel, please do not think that this is the answer or the only way forward. I encourage you to find strength in believing in yourself and trying to accept who you are. I still have my off days too, days I wake up and hate myself for my faults, but I know I have them, they are a part of me I want to change and I try to work on them, and that’s enough to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU are allowed to be you. Keep fighting the good fight.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"hi. i am 17 and am feeling truly helpless at this point in my life. i have been going through severe depression on and off for about a year (the last 3 or 4 months id say were pretty solidly severe) and before that my episodes varied in range greatly but rarely ever had any gaps between them. this has been going on since about 12 or 13, getting worse over time.

last year my two siblings moved out on their own terms (we have an abusive father and parents have a toxic falling in-and-out relationship) and after years of my father denying going to therapy or getting help, he finally decided to let us (me and my parents) see a counsellor. both him and my mother barely went and have stopped going months ago after feeling like they were fine enough (though i disagree, their relationship is still very unhealthy).

i have been going to counselling/therapy for a year already and have had many talks / pleas from not only me but also my counsellor about taking me to a psychiatrist for my depression and anxiety. my parents said no.

they dont even want me to SEE if i need help, they dont want me to have any option at all to be diagnosed. i feel like it comes from misguidance about side effects of prescription antidepressants, but as much as both me and my counsellor have explained the misconceptions and logistics, my mother still won't let me go see a psychiatrist.

we started cbt a few months ago because of this, because my mother was / is convinced that i can simply use cbt to overcome my issues, and wants to see me ""try it out first"" like i can just pick either. the problem is, i usually struggle to follow the workbook or the application of learned tools when my body is physically off and tired, when i am procrastinatory and moody, etc. which i can't really snap out of just by ""willing myself"" to.

(this is because with severe depression, you usually need combination treatment to tackle that stubborn bitch.)

i'm not sure what to do? i want to ask again to see if i can at least try some natural supplements (st. john's wort, higher doses of L-theanine? [i have taken some before but not consistently / for depression, only during anxiety spirals / attacks] ) but i am afraid of even bringing it up.

i want to know if i would be able to get antidepressants by myself at this age? though i can't get a prescription currently, are there ways to get prozac or zoloft online? are there over the counter antidepressants that i can get without prescription that will do the job? genuinely looking for help / answers..google isn't my best friend here.

,depression_help,"First off i want to start with me being an idiot.

Now, there's this girl whom i've liked for quite a while, we went on a date once, we got to the point where we had sex and that was it, point is, we met two years ago by that point and i just recently started to like her, and she claimed to have feelings for me. Well, she didn't, and after the date she told me that she felt nothing at all and i felt... Used, manipulated, something like that so that she would have sex, i don't know.
Some months later i thought she started having feelings for me and got hurt again, but that one's on me.

Now, about a month ago or so, she just texted me again with a meme/pic saying ""How nice would it be to start off new year being with you"", kind of declaring that she had feelings for me. This time i was kind of... Afraid, because it had been bad for me the other times and i couldn't really tell if she was telling the truth or not, so i kind of tested her, turns out she is even more expressive than me when she likes someone (or so i thought) and, just yesterday we met again, i had decided that she was telling the truth and went for it. It was the best day of my life, we played that little table soccer thing, we watched ""My neighbor Totoro"", i cooked her for lunch and she loved it. We had sexual interaction (but did not get to the act as it is) We cuddled for about an hour until she had to leave,etc. I loved this day.

Well, whatever, she kind of blocked me from some social media, and has been ignoring my messages, when she responds she does it in a totally uninterested way. Like, all of a sudden all these feelings she claimed to have for me banished. Like she wants nothing from me anymore. And i feel used again, for her own pleasure or something. I know it has been little time after our date, but the change in her attitude is just so sudden and radical... I feel like she used me again, and i think i should ask her but... Man it just hurts so much... I actually thought this was going to be great, we have a lot of things in common, we always have something to talk about, something to do... I thought it would work... But know it's like... Gone.

I don't know what to think and my mind can't get over the fact that she used me again, and i just can't figure out why.
Why would she even do that?
What does she get from doing that?
Just why...
It doesn't help that i have a history of being really depressive and that i was in recovery, i was doing great but, i just fell all the way back and i'm fighting with myself, struggling to keep those suicidal thoughts away from me...
And that's why it hurts me so much.

I was doing great man, and i thought it would get even better with her... But i'm back at the bottom, somehow...

,depression_help,"Every morning my alarm rings at 6:30am, it does not feel like a reminder to wake up anymore, more like a reminder that I have to be awake for another painful day. I drag myself out of bed and feel zombish no matter how many hours of sleep I got because I can't remember the last time I felt fully rested. I get ready for school, head downstairs to once again not eat breakfast in the hope of slimming down. The mirror next to the door stares me down, judging me and my ugly body until I leave my house at 7:10 every morning. 

At this rate I can practically predict every time I feel social anxiety. People in their cars staring at me as I wait for the bus, getting on the bus makes me panic because the search for a seat can be the most dauting thing in the world. School has been gradually declining even if I've convinced my mum I'm getting all A's. I have no regard for the school rules anymore and I hate most of the people in my school, even if I have no reason to.

Fast forward, I get home, breathe a sigh of relief, probably recieve some shit from my mum and lie in bed scrolling through social media and feeling like shit because everyone seems to be way happier than me. Back to sleep and the cycle continues.

I would maybe tell my best friend about this but its hard to unload. I feel like all the joy has been sucked out of my life. Don't get me wrong I do have laughs, I do go out with friends and have fun, but theres always something wrong, like the happiness won't last and I'm just fooling myself.

,depression_help,"Hi. I'm 22M and recently moved out of my parents' place to go to uni. Since then, I've obviously met new people. One of my new mates confided in me about their parents abusing them and I haven't been able to distract myself from his story. It's so eerily similar to mine, but he called it abuse, which is a word I've never used. In a nutshell, my father's always been quite aggressive towards me. He calls me names that, as a kid, I couldn't repeat, and he uses anything and everything that upsets me against me. He's gotten physical a handful of times and he's threatened my life on five or six different occasions over the course of the last decade. It's always been this way though. Whenever we have a row, he reminds me that I deserve it and it's all my fault. It's always taken a hit on my self esteem, and it definitely distracted me from my school work. Sometimes I'd feel so upset at myself for all of it that self harm was a thought that crossed my mind (I never have followed through with it). I've always felt really low about myself though, so maybe I should've. Some nights I was afraid to sleep in my house. Since my mum always reassured me that he really did and does love me, I always let it slide and tend to leave the gruesome details of my feelings out when she talks to me about it. Plus, he apologises every time, but it's always phrased the same way. ""Your mum told me to say sorry, so I'm sorry."" I've brought this up with her but she just gets aggressive and tells me I'm being over dramatic. Is this abuse? If so, how do I go about seeking help?

&lt;p&gt;The community has been going for about a week has around 30 people in in talking about games, films, books, art and much more we are all there to help each other with problems and give advise as people that have been in your position anyway if you want to join the discord please do &lt;a href=""https://discord.gg/bCnUD3n""&gt;https://discord.gg/bCnUD3n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I have had depression for 8 years. So most of my adult life.

Somehow I have managed myself to get help multiple times on my own - school counseler, private psychologist, hospitilised myself when I got obsessive thoughts of ending myself.

But now I feel like I am letting myself slowly deteriorate to death without me noticing.

I dont know how many of you have physical symptoms or get them and I dont care to explain it but I feel my body going.

My teeth are fucked because I just slighltly mange to brush them to remove morning breath.
I am developing ulcer (managed to go to dr to confirm it)
My spine is crooked for laying down on one side so much.
I have accidentally starved and dehydrated myself to the brink of passing out. On new years eve I almost got alcohol poisoning by just drinking 2 shots because I forgot to eat for 3 days.
My hair looks clean but I have curls so I can go on for 2 weeks not washing. And then I do it because I need to keep up appearnces.


Nobody understands how severe my depression is getting because I hide it so well.

Show up, small talk, complaine a little, make jokes and voila all worries from others diffused.

I stole my bfs benzos. Took 2 over a week because I felt so stressed. And then I didnt care anymore about the pills. He didnt notice. I live with him and he dont know.

Because I dont care to tell him and his grandfather died recently so he cant see.

I stopped my meds because I just couldnt call and ask for more.
Cant go to any drs anyomore because I dont care.

Health stuff is free here, I have money to skip waiting lines. My life is good. Own a starting business with good people, bought land, reletionship is nice with everyone and my depression decided to evolve to something sneaky.

If I dont have to do anything then I just lay on the couch. Thats it. Then bf comes home and I act that I care to watch and do stuff. 

I dont know why I wrote this. Guess I just needed a place where to write my story if now.

,depression_help,"I have been trying self help things for years and it has never done anything to help me and I’m to the point that I think I need to get on anti-depressants. The only problem with this is I have no idea how. Is it possible to ask a general practitioner about that? And besides that, I have barely any insurance under my parents insurance (I am 22) and they definitely would not let me go to the doctor for this, I’m not even allowed to go to a general practitioner. I go to a doctor maybe once every few years if I think something is really wrong. But I know if I tell them I need to go to a doctor for this they will not let me go and tell me to suck it up and deal with it, I’m sure their logic would be something along the lines of “you’ve made it this far you’ll be fine you don’t need to go to a doctor”. I went to them about anxiety once already and they told me I’m fine and to drop it, that I don’t need to go in to get help about it.

Right now I live alone and work part time in which I barely make enough money to live off of. I’m trying to find a full time job but haven’t even gotten an interview at all of the places I’ve applied. So basically if I went to a doctor I wouldn’t be able to afford it because our insurance covers almost nothing, and I especially don’t have any prescription coverage so I don’t even know if I could afford what I would need. I have not been diagnosis’s but I’m pretty sure I have anxiety and depression, possibly bipolar as well.

I’m at a loss here I really feel like it gets worse and worse every day and I just want to give up. I don’t know what to do. I’m hoping someone here was in a similar situation and might be able to help me in some way, like if you know if there is something I can do to get diagnosed and a prescription at a lower cost or how much it might cost me out of pocket to do all of this? I just don’t want my parents involved because I know they will get really mad at me for going to a doctor and getting help, which frustrates me endlessly. I’ve heard therapy is pretty expensive so I don’t think I want to try that, and my anxiety is so bad I know I would get nowhere going to a therapist because I can hardly vocalize what’s wrong the majority of the time.

I've started shutting people out of my life. I absolutely hate myself, I bite and pick my lips until I draw blood, I have zero actual friends, I feel uncomfortable in my own skin, and it all feels invalid. I find myself constantly insulting myself throughout the day, and although I'm fully aware of it and able to differentiate between positive and negative thoughts, it feels justified and more than deserved.

I don't cut myself. I have no diagnosis and don't plan on seeking one. I get straight A's and am on track to be valedictorian. Yet I feel awful every day. Friends of mine have had MDD and PTSD and  a c t u a l l y  used to cut. One of my friends is in an awful family situation that's far worse than mine. And after reading through some of these subreddits seeking advice, I've seen so many other posts from people who have it worse.

I feel like I don't deserve to talk to anyone about it. It seems so selfish and inconsiderate, especially considering how much better I probably have it than others. Like wah I hate myself, big deal, who cares. It's probably justified considering I have  z e r o  friends.

I've lost interest in my academics and my many extracurriculars. I used to have an unspoken drive and motivation to do everything, but now it just feels like another task to drag myself through in the process of surviving another day. The only reason I still maintain it all is because it's the standard I set and it's what others expect of me... I honestly feel powerless to change it, and I know dragging myself through it will be better in the long run.

I feel like I don't deserve to be loved. Someone made me tea and I cried because I felt like a jackass for making such a problem. I didn't even end up drinking it because I felt so undeserving. Even writing this is giving me a lump in my throat because I feel like such an absolute jackass.

I'm starting to feel like it's all so invalid. I deserve to have it worse. I deserve to hurt. I deserve to bear all the burdens others do before I get help because it's probably not even that bad. So many others cut and cry and die alone. Why do I deserve any better than them when they have it worse than I do. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel more and more ungrateful and hateful about myself with every passing day. What do I do?

I'm sick in the literal sense, I have a neurological illness that causes non stop pain in my head and they're thinking its also attacking my abdomen and hands. Everything has increased over time, and some months I spend longer in bed than not. My head never stops hurting, it hurts to walk, the pain flare-ups are so bad I nearly pass out, sex hurts, orgasming is excruciatingly painful, frequently jerk and twitch so people look at me funny, and now my hands. 

I'm an artist... Take anything from me but my hands. This illness is taking everything from me. I can't sleep well because I hurt so much. Sometimes I wake up screaming. And everything just keeps getting worse with no answers. So many tests, so many meds, nothing leads to anything. There is no relief, I can't do anything to escape it. And now I'm losing my reason to live, my art, to the pain.

But the more it comes to things like finals or any kind of decision i have to make which affects my life in a certain way i feel unsafe and more important i feel my depression braking through again. Means as i write this i did not sleep for 3 days and im in a constant state of worry of every kind. I feel depressed about the fact that my parents are going to be gone one day, that i am going to be gone one day and lots more of irrational stuff i cant change in any way. I know that for a fact i cant change the cycle of life but i cant convince my emotions about it. My girlfriend is a very good help but she only knows like 75% of my worries and im trying to open more and more to maybe get her to understand my irrational fears.

I just had to tell anyone about it. I did not want my parents to know about it because they become worried very fast and are prone to tears and i dont wanna do that to them.

Only reason im still here is because I havent figured out the logistical nightmare of erasing myself from this earth without being a hassle to anyone...

I'm not clinically diagnosed with depresion nor have I been in ""profesional"" help, I have been to a 4 day corse to help me deal with my dyslexia that also goes into psychological problems where I left only feeling worse about myself despite manging to break my habit of just bottling it up to myself but crying my eyes out infrond of 5 strangers and not being able to do 1/3 of the exercises because i just froze up or wasnt able to positively thing about myself wasnt really all that helpfull.

This is the first time I'm really opening up about my mental health. Please read to the end.

When I was 11, I started cutting for the first time. I got caught by my mom (duh... I was 11!) and she sent me to therapy. That was 6 years ago.

Last year I started cutting again. I was at a really low point in September, and my parents knew about it (not the s/h). We talked about therapy but it never went through. I started feeling better but not for long. I'm not sure what triggered everything, but I know I need help.

I feel like I'm faking, because I still do my makeup, get dressed nicely, etc. but it's less because I want to and more because I'm expected to/I feel like I'm playing a role in a play.

,depression_help,"Edit Title: Not Sure I Should Check Myself Into The Psych Hospital

I’ll put more details here tmmr since I’m really exhausted rn from existing

Alright so my depression has come back full force and I have trouble getting motivated to do schoolwork, going to school, waking up in the morning, taking care of myself, etc.

School stress has rlly taken a toll on me, especially the college process which I foolishly tried to mold my whole personality around for 3 years, trying to shape the perfect application without even consciously knowing it until the last minute. This sparked an identity crisis within me about a month ago, plus ever since my internship ended I’ve had trouble finding things to fill my time with as now my time is unstructured which leaves for risky room for my thoughts to ruminate and my control over my life to spiral out of control as I stay in my house all the time and just waste my time distracting myself with YouTube and Netflix.

Also I live in a conflicted household where every weekend my parents argue and this weekend it got rlly bad (not the first time) along the lines of threatening violence (not gonna say all the details on a public site). My parents have hated each other since I can remember and my dad is emotionally abusive. This has destroyed my mental health ever since I was 9 and I first wanted to die when I was 9.

I feel like this fact along with the school stress and college process questioning my inner values and my identity has led to my severe depression (it first rlly started in middle school, more details to be edited) coming back now.

Ok so my main question is, if I check into a psych hospital will it actually change anything or will I just return back home to the same messed up situation where my depression will come back anyway and nothing can help me or change my situation? 

Is it expensive to stay in a psych hospital?

Will they make me take all my clothes off to search for anything that I might harm myself with?

What about school? Will my grades suffer extremely and I’ll be stressed again trying to get them back up which may not even be a plausible thing to do?

And biggest question: Exactly what happens?

There’s so many things behind this post, but I’m trying to keep it short. I could write an essay or a book if I could but this is a Reddit post.

I really hate dealing with the authorities and I’m just scared of the possibility of dealing with CPS or any other authorities. My whole family will hate me for it, so thus my mental health will not get better

Also PS I’m not suicidal rn, I’m just rlly depressed and I need therapy but I feel like I need intensive services especially to get my family’s attention on how urgent this issue is",t2_mfa23,False,,0,False,Not sure if I check myself into the psych hospital,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_er8b0u,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579524812.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit Title: Not Sure I Should Check Myself Into The Psych Hospital&lt;/p&gt;

I have lost interest in writing, and I force myself to write for my blog in hopes of reaching out to others who have similar interests.

It also doesn't help that I keep having nightmares of confrontations with her.

,depression_help,"Over the past year or so has been shit to say the least. I have lost my grandfather on my dads side, and then my grandmother on my moms side. If that hadn't been hard enough, my mother was brought into the hospital for treatment for her on going issue with alcoholism, and needed to put her under to check her out, except she crashed when they did and was left on life support due to how bad her body was shutting down from years of abuse to drugs and alcohol. This broke me, but I figured I would be fine. A month later, my at the time GF of 5 years and i sat down and had a long talk, that resulted with us breaking up, it was civil and we have remained friends since. With this, I found it was super hard to live her her, let alone share a bed with her, and moved out after a month into my mothers old place. I did fine for about 5 weeks, but I just keep breaking down, overwhelmed with how quickly my life turned to shit. Ever since i moved out, i can feel myself getting deeper and deeper into this pit of sadness, but i have only friends online who do what they can. I've lost all interest in everything i loved, working out, singing, playing video games with my friends. My sleep schedule is all fucked and ill sleep for 14+ hours to not have to be awake. The only piece of happiness i have left, is the dog i got with my ex a year ago. She is my entire world, but i don't get to see her often and it kills me to leave when i do see her.

I've lost all hope for any goals and ambitions, they are still there and i have these ideas on how to get them but actually making then happen seems so out of reach. I work as a Call Company fire member at my local fire department but that only pays for calls i go on and its once a month, but has become impossible to do as i was on the Department with my ex and we used her car to get to calls. The only other car belongs to my brother that he uses for work, so I'm stuck home all the time.

My only hope, is when we sell my mothers old house and split the money, so i can get my own car, and work on my goals, but even that sounds like a fairy tale at this point. I'm just so lost, being a social guy, now alone. Someone who use to be proud of how he looks, now scared of a scale and mirrors. Once athletic, now i can barley run mile without passing out. I feel so broken, and I'm unsure how to fix myself, unsure if ill ever be happy.  I've tried explaining to others what i felt, but was brushed aside and told to ""man the fuck up, and just deal with it"". I'm tired of something small causing a full blown meltdown and breaking down over nothing because mentally I'm so worn out.

I moved to the US just a few months ago. I really wanted to move away from my home country so I was happy when this happened. I have lived in the US before so I thought it won't be challenging at all.

But it IS challenging. I got older than when I last lived in this country, so I neglected the fact that I changed! Just like how it's easier for a kid to learn a foreign language and harder for adults, now that I came back after I aged, everything feels just harder.

It’s a long story and I’m sure everyone reading this will think I’m weird.

So I think I’m probably gay but it’s been really weird and I’m not even sure. Years ago I started to feel that I don’t like my appearance and it almost feels like my brain or whatever desperately wants me to be in a different body, that is, the same gender as me of course. I always tell myself that it’s not okay but that’s not how really how your inner self work. 
The thing is, the change that I (for some reason) want is to get fat. It’s weird because I wasn’t really that skinny anyway. I always imagined as a kid that my soul was too big for my body, and I’m pretty sure as a teenager that’s definitely not the case.
I think about this more and more and it’s been bugging me for some time now. 
I have a friend who’s probably what that inner self (sorry idk what to call that inner voice that keeps bugging me) considers to be my ideal body. (I know it sounds creepy) I started to feel that I always wanted him to live better than me. 

**There is one thing to make clear: although I think I might be gay, I don’t necessarily “love” him, he’s just a good friend from my high school and we hang out a lot.**

He once broke his arm and, when I heard the news, I just snapped. I have broken my arm before and it wasn’t even that painful. But for some reason, that day when he broke his arm I feel so weird deeply that I don’t even know what that feeling is. I started to be very protective of him and it’s started to annoy him a bit. At first these thoughts seemed fine until recently when it started to drive me suicidal.
I get worried every time he goes to play basketball, skiing or whatever after that. It’s making anxious, and I can’t even tell him bc he will just think I’m weird and not believe in me. I know you would think none of this make sense, trust me, I think that too. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me and it’s just making me confused and terrified to face the future. It sure doesn’t sound serious but when you have to deal with these weird voices coming from nowhere, it’s a totally different story.
I just have to figure out a way to sort out this mess or it will likely keep bugging me until the day I finally decided to hang myself or whatever.

Hi, 

I am recently been socializing with so many people. I have seen people in different states and I just feel negativity within me whenever I see someone in a bad situation. For example, 

1) a friend had horrible time getting money. He was almost homeless. He did really bad because he was unemployed by the time and no one was helping. Meantime I was around him, I felt that I am in his place. That I am in that desperate situation. Its so bad that I started to have low vibes around him and everyone. I started to focus on his energy to raise for me to even feel better about my situation, even though I was totally fine at the time. I started to have anxieties seeing myself in his shoes. It wasnt even helpful at all 

2) there is someone I am developing feelings for who is my neighbor. I flirt a bit with a it seems like she is neutral to it and not taking me seriously. I kissed and hugged her few times. Held hands. Walked and I even told her I missed her. Well, its unstable and maybe I am being a bit pushy. Anyway, today my friends were telling about a creepy guy at their room that is overwhelming them with attention and following them around. I immediately had low self confidence and thought perhaps my “crush” could think the same of me and say the same too?? 

3) I see few homeless people sleeping on the street and imagine myself in their place. I immediately have panic attacks of “what if” one day I am left alone to sleep on the street with no place to store my stuff, no bathroom, no place to go and be exposed to the public. But then I look the other direction and see all those other people that are living their lives and have homes. I literally look at the apartment buildings and ask myself: what are the chances, since the number of people having homes are much higher than the number of homeless people. Why should I be with that group? I literally dont drink, smoke, or mess around with my health not to end up in such bad situation. 

Please help me explain my intrusive thoughts thinking. I am being sensitive for others influence even if it has nothing to do with me. Low self esteem and believing in signs.

,depression_help,"I (22m) have recently discovered reddit. With the wonderful people and comments I see through many posts I think this is possibly the only place where I can actually reveal what is happening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in college trying to get into university in Canada. The goal is to go to MED school to be a doctor. The issue is I have my transcripts yet I shiver at the thought of uploading them. This has happened to me throughout my entire life. Applying to College to upgrade for Uni, studying for a test, trying to make friends, even thinking of leaving the house is all terrifying and crippling to the point where writing this I'm shaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I was admitted to the hospital because I shared with my Chaplain (Catholic School in Canada) that I was having suicidal thoughts and couldn't see any other option. The doctor who oversaw me said something about generalized anxiety but I'm not so sure since I held back a lot about what I was actually going through. When my parents found out my mother reacted by breaking down and Father by being confused and uncomfortable. My parents are kind and loving yet don't have the highest emotional intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then I have patched my relationships with my parents and they think I'm fine. However I had a breakdown in front of my father. Parents are separated so only he knows. I showed him a small glimpse of my insecurities and he looked extremely uncomfortable. It was about how I feel disgusting and worthless over wasting time in my education and being a waste and strain to my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

The saddest part is this is only the tip of the iceberg; I've been trying to find cooping strategies and methods to improve my mental health but it's not working. At my worst I was having full blown hallucinations not knowing reality from fiction. For some reason they stopped after the hospital visit and I don't fell a need to take my life, yet I do think about it if I'm being honest. I know the advice will be to come out to my parents about this or to a friend but that is not an option. I would rather suffer in silence than hurt anyone with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've hidden this by using what I call my mask; a reflection of the ideal me that interacts with everyone so they won't suspect anything. I've done things and accomplished things that make my family proud and happy; yet all I fell is either shame, disgust, anger, or worst of all nothing about everything. For most of my life I've felt nothing, I'm somehow able to stuff it all in a corner in my mind and go numb.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this would be considered depression as I've never been diagnosed yet all I know is that I'm spiraling. I know life shouldn't be this way yet I know nothing else. I apologise if this is the wrong subreddit to post this but I need help. Thank you to whoever can help. And sorry for unloading this all on here.

&lt;p&gt;The saddest part is this is only the tip of the iceberg; I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find cooping strategies and methods to improve my mental health but it&amp;#39;s not working. At my worst I was having full blown hallucinations not knowing reality from fiction. For some reason they stopped after the hospital visit and I don&amp;#39;t fell a need to take my life, yet I do think about it if I&amp;#39;m being honest. I know the advice will be to come out to my parents about this or to a friend but that is not an option. I would rather suffer in silence than hurt anyone with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve hidden this by using what I call my mask; a reflection of the ideal me that interacts with everyone so they won&amp;#39;t suspect anything. I&amp;#39;ve done things and accomplished things that make my family proud and happy; yet all I fell is either shame, disgust, anger, or worst of all nothing about everything. For most of my life I&amp;#39;ve felt nothing, I&amp;#39;m somehow able to stuff it all in a corner in my mind and go numb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this would be considered depression as I&amp;#39;ve never been diagnosed yet all I know is that I&amp;#39;m spiraling. I know life shouldn&amp;#39;t be this way yet I know nothing else. I apologise if this is the wrong subreddit to post this but I need help. Thank you to whoever can help. And sorry for unloading this all on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m crumbling from the inside out and have no way to stop it or anyone to help. Please help me?!&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Sorry if this isn't the best place to ask, I'm not exactly sure where to go.

In short, I'm a 19 year old who has been more-or-less socially isolated since around the age of 11, getting really bad at 14. I dropped out of highschool getting a GED at 16. At some point I tried community college but had a breakdown one or two days in and just never went back.

I isolated myself as a result of both anxiety and depression- I have never gotten professional help for it, and at the moment at least I can't expect to be able to. (I've tried recently)

My motivation has been about nothing this whole time, even when I've wanted ""desperately"" to have done something. In my isolation I have not developed any hobbies or skillsets, nor have I gotten a job or maintained any friendships. I can't drive. Put simply, I have no idea how to do anything. I admit that I'm incredibly lucky with not being kicked out of my room at this rate, but otherwise I can't rely on help or support from my family.

In my isolation my anxiety &amp; depression have worsened to horrible degrees and my social skills have atrophied from bad to shaking, turning red and stuttering for the most part. I can only describe going outside as feeling like I'm in a fever dream.

Apologies if this seems like just a whole lot of whining or disoriented- I've sat here for hours trying to figure out how to put things.

I've come to the understanding that living with my family is making my issues a lot worse, so I've tried to set ""get out"" as a personal goal, but every step I look at seems to be barred off by something I've never learned or just don't have the mental strength to push myself through right out of this stagnation.

I guess what I'm trying to ask for is like, just suggestions for easing out of this isolation &amp; stagnation? What can I do to start from here? I know ""one thing at a time"" but my eyes seem too muddied by the situation to even see those first few steps. I understand it's not going to be easy and things won't all come at once, I'm essentially trying to catch up on years upon years that I just *skipped* while hoping to become a person for what feels like the first time.

As a side note, though I don't expect help with this at all as I'm just voicing a silly concern, I'm hoping it's just anxiety but I'm worried that I've developed circulatory issues in all this time and that when things get ""better"" enough to address it everything will have been for not.

&lt;p&gt;In short, I&amp;#39;m a 19 year old who has been more-or-less socially isolated since around the age of 11, getting really bad at 14. I dropped out of highschool getting a GED at 16. At some point I tried community college but had a breakdown one or two days in and just never went back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I isolated myself as a result of both anxiety and depression- I have never gotten professional help for it, and at the moment at least I can&amp;#39;t expect to be able to. (I&amp;#39;ve tried recently)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motivation has been about nothing this whole time, even when I&amp;#39;ve wanted &amp;quot;desperately&amp;quot; to have done something. In my isolation I have not developed any hobbies or skillsets, nor have I gotten a job or maintained any friendships. I can&amp;#39;t drive. Put simply, I have no idea how to do anything. I admit that I&amp;#39;m incredibly lucky with not being kicked out of my room at this rate, but otherwise I can&amp;#39;t rely on help or support from my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my isolation my anxiety &amp;amp; depression have worsened to horrible degrees and my social skills have atrophied from bad to shaking, turning red and stuttering for the most part. I can only describe going outside as feeling like I&amp;#39;m in a fever dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this seems like just a whole lot of whining or disoriented- I&amp;#39;ve sat here for hours trying to figure out how to put things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come to the understanding that living with my family is making my issues a lot worse, so I&amp;#39;ve tried to set &amp;quot;get out&amp;quot; as a personal goal, but every step I look at seems to be barred off by something I&amp;#39;ve never learned or just don&amp;#39;t have the mental strength to push myself through right out of this stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to ask for is like, just suggestions for easing out of this isolation &amp;amp; stagnation? What can I do to start from here? I know &amp;quot;one thing at a time&amp;quot; but my eyes seem too muddied by the situation to even see those first few steps. I understand it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy and things won&amp;#39;t all come at once, I&amp;#39;m essentially trying to catch up on years upon years that I just &lt;em&gt;skipped&lt;/em&gt; while hoping to become a person for what feels like the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, though I don&amp;#39;t expect help with this at all as I&amp;#39;m just voicing a silly concern, I&amp;#39;m hoping it&amp;#39;s just anxiety but I&amp;#39;m worried that I&amp;#39;ve developed circulatory issues in all this time and that when things get &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; enough to address it everything will have been for not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time and sorry for the rambling. Feel free to ask any questions for clarification&amp;#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Okay, first of all, I need to make a disclaimer. I have yet to be diagnosed for ADHD (which at this point, I 99.9% believe I have at this point). And that might the root of my problems. But due to some financial reasons, I can't go down this route yet.

Since sophomore year of high school, I suffered through sleep issues. Like I literally not ever get enough. I would randomly fall asleep in the middle of the day. I took a lot of naps during my free periods (and sometimes during class). And all I wanted to do after getting home after school was take a nap. Even while studying, I still take naps. I was always sooo tired. And no amount of sleep would help.

Since I've started treatment on Lexapro, I've notice some improvement. I've haven't needed to take mid-day naps, and it gets me a bit more motivated to start the day. So I guess I feel less lethargic? Idk. Even so, I still really struggle with getting up in the morning.

But then, come freshman year of college and here come the magic remedy: alcohol. No seriously. It's weird af, but if I get drunk the night before, I actually wake up (albeit tired and hungover sometimes). Not only I NOT turn off my alarm and snooze away, but I get up really early (like 6 am or 7 am) even if I go to bed late (12 am-2 am). And it is epic.

But of course, alcohol can't be the solution to my problems. And luckily, I have the great ability to control my drinking habits (I don't drink unless I'm partying, which isn't often). But I can't help thinking how much it eases my anxious thoughts and it's great ability to wake me up. It would be great if I could find a drug that works the same way and won't destroy my liver lololol.

Is there anybody else who experiences this? If so, what have you tried? And people with drug knowledge, is there an antidepressant that works like alcohol? I'm seriously considering changing treatments.

,depression_help,"Today, I had my first ever full-on mental breakdown. All the stress in the world just crashing down on you. Because of this, I want to share my view on depression summed up simply. I will also be marking this as NSFW to avoid encouraging anyone to do something unhealthy. Here goes nothing.

There is a constant struggle between two forces that develops within each person. The mind against the body. The mind’s ideology is making each person understand that life is a disease and suicide is the cure. On the contrary, the body follows the primal instinct of survival. Depression is the slow and painful journey of the mind's victory. 

As my depression spiraled out of control, I began to stop getting scared. No fear of heights, no fear of the dark, no fear of death. As things got worse, my fears just went away. My body is starting to realize that survival isn't the goal anymore. That's how I knew my idea of depression had more truth than I originally had thought.

If the next part is against the rules for this sub, I apologize. Delete this post. If it isn't, then this is my final warning. The next part should be replicated by absolutely nobody.

With this knowledge, and the will to experiment, I began to find ways to speed the process up. I wanted my body to feel the torment my brain goes through on a daily basis. Cutting, punching the wall, hitting rocks against my skull, even sexual torture. Anything to speed this up. And it worked. I'm not afraid of anything anymore. I'm not in control of my actions. The war is over.

Rather than my mind being tired of existing, everything associated with me wants to die. If you made it this far, understand help will come one way or another. I let my past engulf me too fast. Help was coming and now I believe it's too late. I wanted to feel happy, but now I don't care. I just want people not to worry about me.

Depression is the slow and painful journey of the mind&amp;#39;s victory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my depression spiraled out of control, I began to stop getting scared. No fear of heights, no fear of the dark, no fear of death. As things got worse, my fears just went away. My body is starting to realize that survival isn&amp;#39;t the goal anymore. That&amp;#39;s how I knew my idea of depression had more truth than I originally had thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the next part is against the rules for this sub, I apologize. Delete this post. If it isn&amp;#39;t, then this is my final warning. The next part should be replicated by absolutely nobody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this knowledge, and the will to experiment, I began to find ways to speed the process up. I wanted my body to feel the torment my brain goes through on a daily basis. Cutting, punching the wall, hitting rocks against my skull, even sexual torture. Anything to speed this up. And it worked. I&amp;#39;m not afraid of anything anymore. I&amp;#39;m not in control of my actions. The war is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than my mind being tired of existing, everything associated with me wants to die. If you made it this far, understand help will come one way or another. I let my past engulf me too fast. Help was coming and now I believe it&amp;#39;s too late. I wanted to feel happy, but now I don&amp;#39;t care. I just want people not to worry about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to end this, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello.  

I’ve been suffering from diagnosed severe depression and anxiety for almost two years. In these past 2 years, I have experienced so much excruciating mental pain, suffering, and despair. I spend every single day in the deepest hole that I will never be able to dig myself out of. My anxiety makes every second a personal purgatory, coping with stress over minuscule details and deadlines. This past month has hit me particularly hard. I have been in a relationship for almost two years in a couple of months, but this relationship has been rocky over the past 6 months. This relationship was originally the only thing keeping me from ending my life, hoping I had a future with this woman. Slowly, as the disagreements and arguments advance, I can feel this future and all of our plans slipping away. There is a disagreement or argument every other day, and this just adds to my deep despair. This relationship has become especially difficult in recent weeks and days, and as it deepens, I realize how much pain I truly am in. I take 100mg of Zoloft daily, I attend therapy sessions, and I have supportive friends who are aware of my struggles, however, none of these have helped my deep feelings of pain and suffering. My childhood was filled with physical, verbal, and mental abuse that continues to this day through my divorced parents’ “cold war” and my father’s continued harassment and belittlement. Figures that assumed roles of mentorship and support slowly delve into roles of mental torture. Through my experiences with depression and anxiety, I have never been able to escape the comforting thought of finally losing everything that has continuously caused dread and despair. Underneath everything, my mind is in a war within itself. Underneath everything, my anxiety is causing stress over the most efficient method of ending my life. I am mentally unable to continue escaping these feelings and I feel myself delving deeper and deeper into a dark inescapable void. I am unaware of how long I can continue feeling this way without taking an action that ends everything.",t2_4pahrhug,False,,0,False,I am lost.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING SUPPORT'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_eqbr8e,False,dark,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING SUPPORT,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579350108.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"(Let me know if there's some other subreddit this would be more / equally appropriate for.)

I'm 26, and currently living at home with my parents while I'm between jobs and recovering from some rough life experiences (including going overseas to pursue something of a dream career, getting dysentery and nearly dying, and realising that that particular career isn't really safe for me to do). Everyone in my family has depression - my parents have both been struggling with it since before they met, and I've only realised in the last three or four years that what I thought was normal life was actually depression. We've never really been a happy family - we love each other, and there's never been any conflict or abuse or anything like that, but we're all pretty messed up people just as a baseline.

At the moment, though, my parents are *vastly* worse off than I am.

My dad is burned out beyond all recognition by work. He's super unsatisfied by his job, but it makes good money and he feels like he can't leave and take anything with less of a salary; and he's high enough up and has enough responsibility that he feels like he can't possibly ask to do any less, or set anything aside for later. He's the kind of person, though, who will always give his job 150%, not because he's enthusiastic, but because he believes that if he can give 150%, giving 145% is 1) shameful and 2) likely to get him fired. I take it that he believes that if giving 150% all the time kills him, so be it - at least no one can say he didn't try. The result of this for us, though, is that he comes home from work and sits down in his chair and becomes a lump of rock for the rest of the evening - sometimes we're lucky to get two words out of him. Attempting to talk to him about much of anything results in a quick end to the conversation; if you try and talk to him about how he's feeling (even trying to help him!) he runs away - either emotionally by insisting there's nothing wrong and he's 'just tired', or literally by getting up and walking out of the room.

My mom has chronic illness (she's been diagnosed with chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia), and has some pretty significant health anxiety. Some of her aches and pains are familiar and just frustrating; some of them send her into a state of terror and acute distress (and even if she's not in such a state, she regularly asks me things like 'does this mean I'm dying?' or 'what if I just drop dead from this?'). She sees both her death and mine lurking around every corner. On top of this, she absolutely *hates* that she has these problems, and regularly confesses that she feels like she's only a burden on us and that she figures we must hate her because she can't just be happy and not have problems. She's getting help for herself, but she's been seeing two counselors (a normal one and an EMDR one) for two years now and is beginning to convince herself that she just isn't ever going to get better. (I imagine she will, but I get where she's coming from.)

Neither of them has much of anything in the way of self-esteem, and both of them are the kinds of people who imagine myriad responsibilities for themselves that no one is actually expecting them to fulfill and then feel like failures when they can't fulfill them all anyway. They've got good reasons for this stuff, though - my mom's older brother had some serious mental health issues including suicidal depression for many years when she was very small (I think it started when she was three or four), and my dad grew up as a third-culture kid caught between the US and his stoic post-war Norwegian parents who had *absolutely zero* support for him or even understanding of what he was going through. (He refuses to see a counselor because he hates the idea of having to explain all of his mess to them, and he (quite rightly IME) fears that they won't understand his third-culture-kid experience any better than his parents did. Shockingly, his mom was a practicing psychologist for decades - you'd never know it looking at him.)

So having dumped all that, my question is this - how do I take care of myself while not only living with but legitimately caring for my parents? I don't want to just close myself down and refuse to even try to help, since I am very obviously more able to care for them well than they are me, and I love them and care about them and want them both to get better. It's very hard to talk to them about how they make me feel - I'm sort of able to talk to my mom about it sometimes, but it's a *very* thin tightrope to walk, since just about anything I say about her contribution to my difficulty is going to just further confirm her sense that she's a worthless burden. (Trying has at times resulted in comments like 'hearing that makes me not want to live anymore', and it quickly turns into me doing damage control rather than having a good frank conversation.) The few tiny cautious attempts I've made to talk to my dad result in him either *strenuously* defending himself and his honour, or curling up in an emotional ball and not coming out for days on end.

You might call them 'toxic', though I'm not sure exactly what constitutes 'toxic'; but they're certainly not doing this out of selfishness or callousness or narcissism or anything like that. I know my mom hates that she causes me problems, and I imagine my dad would as well if he really knew (and was willing to talk about it). The problem is that I can't just ask them to change, since they would have long ago if they could, and I don't want to just write them off as toxic and/or leave since that feels entirely unfair to them, and would utterly crush at least my mom if not also my dad. I'd love to move out and just get out of the situation entirely, but that requires getting a decent-paying job (not easy when you're only really wanting something to tide you over between careers - I can maybe hope for 15$ an hour, but that's not enough to live on where I live). Just moving out anyway and living on savings for a while would be just another way to tell them 'you have too many problems and I have to leave', which again, would be the end of the world to my poor mother and probably would hit my dad pretty hard too. Just emotionally separating myself rather than physically separating myself would be pretty difficult, since 1) I'm a *tremendously* empathetic person and can't help but feel others' pain, 2) I really do care about them, and 3) I'd have to start callously refusing to meet my mom's legitimate needs for support in rough spots.

(And of course, if I leave, I leave them to have to live with each other - which I get isn't my responsibility, but feels gross anyway. Neither of them have much in the way of friends at all, and making friends is extremely difficult for both of them since they've both got fifty years experience being misunderstood and excluded.)

I am seeing a counselor, don't worry, and we do talk about this stuff, though one hour a week feels kind of insufficient given all the above. I'd just like to hear some more advice. I have friends and I've kind of talked to them about it, but I have some social anxiety myself and I'm scared to ask for too much from them. They've offered to help however they can, but I don't really know what to ask them for.

(TL;DR - 'how do I take care of my own depression while living with parents who are vastly worse off than me, without just getting up and leaving since that's 1) largely impractical at the moment and 2) if I did it anyway could very well send the message that I don't care about them or their problems when I really, really do.)",t2_wicld,False,,0,False,Dealing with depression while living with parents who are both much worse off than you are,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_eq88rb,False,dark,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,9,,False,,1579303412.0,,[],{},,True,,1579331768.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Let me know if there&amp;#39;s some other subreddit this would be more / equally appropriate for.)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Im pretty sure now that life has no meaning. Maybe it has, but not to me.

Every single thing is painful, tiring, meaningless. Even basic activities are hard...

Eating is hard: ""I'm gonna get fat if I eat too much carbs, I should eat more veggies, I had too much chocolate today, oh no, a beer has so many calories in it!""

Sleeping is hard: Im not going to fall asleep easily, Im just going to roll around in my bed until the floor becomes preferable to sleep on, then the next morning Im going to be tired because I didnt fall asleep, I'll never sleep as much as I want. And even if I do, waking up late makes me feel like garbage...

It's not going to get better. Everyone says it, but how would they know. It's not 100% sure. Some people succeed, some people fail.

Its 2020, we see posts about ""see how much you've changed in just one year wow, you evolved so much wow"". No. Still the same general situation. Still the anxiety crisis, breakdowns, no job, no driving license, family member sick, no money, no motivation.

And even if it does get better somehow, depression and anxiety are going to be stuck to my butt all my life, until I finally die. No thank you. We read everywhere that ""yeah, I still have anxiety/depression, and it's still hard, but I'm happy I chose to fight, I'd do it again."" Meh.

I just wish I could disappear, or that the world would stop, or end. 

How do you log out from your life? Make all the sadness and despair go away.

&lt;p&gt;Every single thing is painful, tiring, meaningless. Even basic activities are hard...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating is hard: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna get fat if I eat too much carbs, I should eat more veggies, I had too much chocolate today, oh no, a beer has so many calories in it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping is hard: Im not going to fall asleep easily, Im just going to roll around in my bed until the floor becomes preferable to sleep on, then the next morning Im going to be tired because I didnt fall asleep, I&amp;#39;ll never sleep as much as I want. And even if I do, waking up late makes me feel like garbage...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etc....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not going to get better. Everyone says it, but how would they know. It&amp;#39;s not 100% sure. Some people succeed, some people fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its 2020, we see posts about &amp;quot;see how much you&amp;#39;ve changed in just one year wow, you evolved so much wow&amp;quot;. No. Still the same general situation. Still the anxiety crisis, breakdowns, no job, no driving license, family member sick, no money, no motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if it does get better somehow, depression and anxiety are going to be stuck to my butt all my life, until I finally die. No thank you. We read everywhere that &amp;quot;yeah, I still have anxiety/depression, and it&amp;#39;s still hard, but I&amp;#39;m happy I chose to fight, I&amp;#39;d do it again.&amp;quot; Meh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wish I could disappear, or that the world would stop, or end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you log out from your life? Make all the sadness and despair go away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not going to get better, I&amp;#39;m not even sure I want it to get better anymore....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty long uninteresting rant.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hey everyone....a close friend of mine is pretty severely depressed and has been for a while now. I’ve been trying to support them as best I can, saying things such as “This must be so hard, I’m here for you and I love you.” “I’m worried about you, would you like to talk?” “How can I best support you?” and things like that, but I don’t really think it’s helping. It’s been almost 5 months now and they’ve quit their job, they don’t often leave the house, and they’re not eating well (if at all). I live in a different state from them so I can’t physically be there, drop in and do things with them, etc. They also have a pretty unstable financial situation and no insurance, so recommending therapy isn’t that easy

I guess what I’m asking is.......how can I best support them? Obviously everyone is different and what helps someone might not help someone else, but what are some of the things friends have done that have helped you the most? I’m open to suggestions. They’ve enrolled in online school starting this semester, and I’ve tried to suggest maybe one class in-person could help to break some routine and get out of the house more, but they weren’t really receptive and I don’t want to be pushy/preachy. 


Lastly, any tips for me in terms of my own mental health? I have my own struggles with my mental health and trying to be there for this friend is, as selfish as it may sound, taking a toll on me. It’s hard. I don’t know where/when to draw the line and put myself first.

((I'm new to reddit, and this is a throwaway account, so please forgive me if I committed any reddit faux pas))

I need help- not direct financial aid, but help navigating the system. I know I should qualify for financial help, but I have no idea how to go about it or which programs to pursue.

I'm scraping by, deep in student loan &amp; hospital debt that I can't afford to pay because I can barely make rent, trying to save up for a super-cheap, used, under $1,000 car so I can get a better job (I currently work retail part time and take painting &amp; illustration commissions part time), but I'm exhausted even working the few hours that I do (thanks, brain). I've been struggling with depression &amp; anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt &amp; an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I can't afford counseling, and I can't get medication without a car. It's been a while since I've been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cult-like Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, ""common"" sense, and a normal view of the world. Because of this, I have no idea how social programs work. I'm still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. I tried applying to Modest Needs, was told I made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.

Any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind I don't have a lot of energy at the moment...

Has anyone who's had similar struggles in the past have any advice? Any resources? A suggestion for a place to start?

...

Other possibly relevant details about me:

\-I know that my income places me solidly under the poverty line

\-I think I may have ADHD or something similar but have never been evaluated for it

\-I was \*\*\*VERY\*\*\* briefly homeless, slept in a tree at one point and in my car (had to sell) another, but there's no documentation of that (it was remarkably short, I'm very lucky)

\-I live in California &amp; I am a US citizen

\-I am cis, pansexual, female, &amp; white as a ream of printer paper

\-I was disowned &amp; cut off by my family for religious reasons

\-I have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, I can't make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best

\-I was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (I brought in credits) when I ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated

\-I pay rent under-the-table, I don't \*legally\* reside at the place I live

\-I have terrible credit- lots of student and medical debt, I've never had a credit card but I've been wondering if getting one might help

\-I've never applied for any governmental assistance before (aside from scholarships)

I can't think of any other details that might be relevant but feel free to ask any questions, aside from this protective anonymity I'm an open book.

I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with depression &amp;amp; anxiety since my freshman year of college (2015), culminating in a suicide attempt &amp;amp; an involuntary stay in a mental hospital a little over two years ago. I can&amp;#39;t afford counseling, and I can&amp;#39;t get medication without a car. It&amp;#39;s been a while since I&amp;#39;ve been on meds. Not sure I would be able to afford it if I could reach it. I was raised in a cult-like Christian conservative homeschooling home, so until college I was very isolated from modern culture, &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; sense, and a normal view of the world. Because of this, I have no idea how social programs work. I&amp;#39;m still scrambling to figure out how the normal world works. I tried applying to Modest Needs, was told I made too little to qualify, started looking at government programs, and got just absolutely completely lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions for ways to make/earn/get money welcome as well, just keep in mind I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of energy at the moment...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone who&amp;#39;s had similar struggles in the past have any advice? Any resources? A suggestion for a place to start?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other possibly relevant details about me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I know that my income places me solidly under the poverty line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I think I may have ADHD or something similar but have never been evaluated for it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I was ***VERY*** briefly homeless, slept in a tree at one point and in my car (had to sell) another, but there&amp;#39;s no documentation of that (it was remarkably short, I&amp;#39;m very lucky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I live in California &amp;amp; I am a US citizen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I am cis, pansexual, female, &amp;amp; white as a ream of printer paper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I was disowned &amp;amp; cut off by my family for religious reasons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I have some, small documentation of my mental illnesses, but because of those same mental illnesses, I can&amp;#39;t make it to a doctor often, so the paper trail is inconsistent, spotty at best&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I was in college 3 years, was in my senior year (I brought in credits) when I ran out of money and had to leave, never graduated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I pay rent under-the-table, I don&amp;#39;t *legally* reside at the place I live&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I have terrible credit- lots of student and medical debt, I&amp;#39;ve never had a credit card but I&amp;#39;ve been wondering if getting one might help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I&amp;#39;ve never applied for any governmental assistance before (aside from scholarships)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of any other details that might be relevant but feel free to ask any questions, aside from this protective anonymity I&amp;#39;m an open book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much to anyone who took the time to read &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hi all. I'm bipolar with treatment resistant depression and self harm issues. I receive ECT every Friday to keep me on track, in addition to taking 4 different medications. To be honest, the ECT is the only reason I'm not currently self harming or dead. My husband is very supportive of my treatment and does his best to keep me stable and in a healthy place.

This last week, I've been having some abdominal pain. My doctor sent me to get an ultrasound and they discovered that I had a cyst on my ovary that ruptured and I was hemorrhaging into my abdominal cavity. I went to the ER and they monitored me for a bit and sent me home. They said it would heal by itself and set up a follow up appointment for tonight (Friday) for another ultrasound to see if the bleeding stopped.

Well, this morning I was set to receive ECT. The nurse got me settled, but asked about my ER visit. I told her that the doctors said it would heal by itself. She told the doctor in charge of the ECT procedure and he said, ""absolutely not. We will not do a treatment until it can be verified that the bleeding is stopped completely."" and sent me home.

I've been receiving ECT once a week for nearly 6 months. Once a week, because stretching the treatment out longer than that usually ends up with me injuring myself or fantasizing about blood and death. I already constantly feel like a burden on my husband and family, and frequently feel like they'd be better without me. ECT would reset those doubts and feelings to where I was actually happy and hopeful. I don't suffer any side effects, other than a bad headache the day of, so my mental health team supports my weekly routine treatment.

Now, I don't have that routine to count on. The earliest they will reschedule me is for Wednesday. That's 5 more days when I already feel desperate for a treatment. I'm paranoid and terrified about what can happen in those 5 days. The only person I can talk to is my husband, and I am worried that I lean on him too much.

,depression_help,"Hello all,

New here.

I have a depression and I am autistic (aspergers), and I have recently decided to share my journey with other people. About how I deal with things (or not) and how I am going to deal with things, how I am (going to be) fighting my depression, and maybe in the process of this all, hopefully be able to not just help myself by talking about these things, but also help other people with simillar issues, or even just give them the courage to talk to someone or get help.

My first video of the year I am just explaining some things about me, where I have been and where I want to go.

But I will be creating more video's (not just about these two subjects) about depression and autism.

Hope you guys and girls appreciate what I am trying to do here, and maybe take the time to watch my video and give me some things to talk about, like, what you want ""regular""/healthy people to know and be made aware of, or just say hi to me and to support me on this.

You can check out my 1st video on this here: [Starting Over](https://youtu.be/3SJ_ETaxo9c)

,depression_help,"I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&amp;#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any gaming company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

,depression_help,"Recently, I've been going into moments where I just break down in frustration/depression; and I can't pinpoint the reason why. I need to find the source of this because it is getting worse and worse. One thing I've been able to analyze is that I've never had any close friends or a sense of what family is. I have no family. It's just me and my parents. There's no family getaways, get togethers, or the sense of spending holidays with family. I was told ridiculously overachieving and most of my symptoms could be a result of this and me trying to hide this issue under the rug throughout my whole childhood. This past year I set really high expectations for myself and was burned out and frustrated trying to accomplish them. I accomplished everything at the end and instead that made me more depressed. I still felt empty as if my depression/frustrations are worse when I actually don't have anything to stress me out if that makes sense. Here's some introspect about myself.

* I expect insane results from everything I do and strive to be the best at very little thing. I even get frustrated in volunteer work when someone else does my tasks instead of me.
* I am extremely competitive in everything even volunteer events.
* I usually have to be control or I feel destroyed.
* I have a very serious/straight personality, so I get insanely frustrated when I see people I know hanging out with their friends/family laughing and having fun because I think they'll like them more than me since I don't have that type of personality. I constantly think people will not like my personality and they'll go with other people instead.
* One of my only friend's friend came back from college, and I hate him already. I think it's jealousy that he's close to the only person I am somewhat close to in my life.
* Even though I hate to admit it, I over-analyze everything I do/say around people because I am afraid they'll like me less or something.
* On an off-day any little thing will bring on a stress-filled breakdown. Especially interactions with people that I feel I messed up
* I was drowning in burn-out and frustration last year. I isolated myself a little bit and feel I lost likability with the people I was talking to at least.
* Even if I make some friends and manage to keep them. Everyone has their own families and best friends. I'll never have people that close to me in my life. It would just be a burden to them to be like a replacement family for me.
* I've been breaking down into stress/depression episodes more and more frequently now to no avail. The hole keeps getting deeper.

You  know those feelings of built up anger, frustration, anxiety, etc? You  know when you just sit there and think, and think, and think, and that's  all you feel able to do with all this built-up emotion? Well, I found  something that helps: exercise. I'm not saying you need to do a routine  or anything, but say, for example, you feel angry with someone or  something, use that anger to do push-ups or go on a jog. It doesn't even  have to be many. Just a few. I was feeling angry and frustrated because  I was tired and I had come home to my mom and stepdad arguing as I  tried to just eat a sandwich. Instead of brooding on those emotions in  my room like usual, I instead did something like 8 pull-ups on a bar  above my door and then 10 push-ups and I feel so much better.

For the last 4 years i have worked a min wage factory job. It was so horrible and my parents kept pushing me to go back to studying and get my life together. They worry about my future and think that to be educated is the only right thing to do. So i did... i just started my path to be an automation technician ( a 4 year long education) . And i fucking hate it!! Im the only female student and its all mathematics and electricity. Not at all what i thought it would be. I expected it to be more like mechanic. I failed math in high school and this is too much. I just cant keep up and the whole education have barely started yet. How on earth am i going to get through.

,depression_help,"Hello Reddit. I come for you, strangers on the internet, in my time of need. Allow me to tell a bit about myself.

I am a 22 years old Brazilian guy. I have an unexplaineble love for music and dream of becoming a local musician, playing on small local concerts and teaching music classes. My family is well structured, have a good income and I never had any difficulties as lacking of money to pay bills, eat, have fun, and studied at great schools (in Brazil, public education sucks). My family is super religious, and I'm an atheist. They put a lot of pressure on me and never fully accepted my lack of religion or supported any of my career choices (game design, philosophy or music).

At age of 18 I joined a Game Design college, to leave at age 19. The following year I started therapy with a blessed lady that still helps me through therapy to this day. That same year I started taking antidepressive pills.

I got into a job at my uncle's company, stayed there only for 3 months, then decided to try (and succeeded) in getting into philosophy college at the best University in town. Stay there for only 7 months before getting frustrated once again with my choice of career and leaving college once again. This time I was decided to pursuit my music passion, got into an awesome band, made musical projects for the year of 2020. I was dedicated and excited, although desperate for a job (part from family pressure, part for me, to feel more mature). So desperated that I was dumb enough to get into a job that would make me incapable to exercise my music projects. So I quit the job I started 2 days ago. This was today. I had a breakdown, started crying and apologizing to my boss. Lucky enough, he is a great guy and understood me, said he was going to pay me for my 2 days of work and wished me the best in my life. Now I'm here, back at me house, where I feel awful, with the pressure from my religious family saying that ""I told you so, you need god, can't you see?""

I thought of killing myself today, very hard, so I decided to come here at Reddit and open up. I feel bad for feeling so bad, don't know if you guys can understand that. When I think that here, in a third world country, I have a great life, still I feel like shit, deep into depression. So this thoughts make me feel EVEN MORE depressed, like if I was an ungrateful child.

I have chronic pain and none of my doctors will help with lessening it. I've gone multiple times over months and years and they have all of my records and know my diseases cause pain. I don't ask for pain meds. I just want something to fucking help. 

I take Prozac for it all. 

I feel like I'm one bad day away from cracking. I'm a stay at home mom. We struggle with bills like anyone else does. I feel like shit that I'm taking care of kids and provide no monetary supplement to help.

I feel like a bitch when I say I need a break. I never get a break. My husband is amazing with the kids. He loves me to pieces. He helps me whenever I ask. He works his job and has his own stress, but I know he doesn't get what I go through.

I attempted to kill myself 3 years ago before I even knew him. I was in an abusive relationship and it was the only way I saw out because I had absolutely no help. 
Even my best friend at the time was not supportive. 

Here I am now losing my patience with everyday tasks because I'm in constant pain. I am severely depressed because I'm constantly thinking about how can I get rid of the pain. 
I have anxiety attacks because of the pain and I'm depressed because of the anxiety I'm experiencing.

I take benedryl to knock myself out at night. I wake up a few hours later and I can't go back to sleep. 

I've gotten referrals from my doctor to see a psychiatrist and therapy for help, but EVERY single referral is met with ""we aren't taking any more patients with your insurance."" I called the places my insurance is accepted and it's the same story everytime.

I can't afford out of pocket and I probably couldn't have weekly sessions because my husband is full-time working mon-fri. I already feel like I ask too much from him when I ask for him to watch the baby while I go to the multiple doctors I see.

,depression_help,"I've lived my life with the hope that something would eventually change, and I would finally be satisfied. However, I am now 23 and it feels like I'm not progressing towards anything that may make me happy. I usually have periods where I feel like trying something new and get out of my comfort zone, and periods like this one when I look back and feel like it was all for nothing.

I think that one of my main weaknesses has always been the absence of experience in some key aspects of life, especially relationships. I never had a girlfriend. I am not bad-looking, but very insecure when dealing with girls in a romantic way (mainly because of the aforementioned lack of experience). I would even go as far to say that my behavior may sometimes be considered asexual - even though I am not. Furthermore, the situation I am in right now (and who knows, perhaps also in the future) does not allow me to meet new people that easily, especially girls (I study computer engineering so yeah... lol).

I feel like this lack of experience also influences other aspects of my life. I don't feel on par with most of the people my age. I feel a not-so-much adult in an adult world, alienated, left behind. This vicious cycle will eventually get worse and worse, as people go on with their life while things will get harder and harder for me to turn around.

That said, I tried to change things - perhaps not hard enough. I asked out a girl I barely knew via DM, she eventually said yes. This was my first date of my life. It went well, or at least it seemed to me, we laughed a lot and I personally had fun. But then she said she was not interested when I asked for a second date a few days later. Thing is, she is literally the only one I could have asked out that I somewhat know. This was one month ago.

And now I am in one of those periods in my life where I feel like this is not going anywhere. I hope it's not true, but it's been like this for all these years. The hypothesis that this may be my life until the end gets more and more realistic as time goes on.

I went to therapy for most of my life - from when I was a child up until 2 years ago, when I was 21. I never had the courage to state that never having been in a relationship was a problem for me. It was something I was ashamed to express my desire of. In general, I never managed to talk freely about my problems there because of this.

I quit therapy after realizing that, after all these years, I was not happy with my life. I agree that it sounds simplistic, but I also wanted to try and live without it and see how I would fare. I still am on my meds though (prescribed from a doctor).

However, I am now 23 and it feels like I&amp;#39;m not progressing towards anything that may make me happy. I usually have periods where I feel like trying something new and get out of my comfort zone, and periods like this one when I look back and feel like it was all for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that one of my main weaknesses has always been the absence of experience in some key aspects of life, especially relationships. I never had a girlfriend. I am not bad-looking, but very insecure when dealing with girls in a romantic way (mainly because of the aforementioned lack of experience). I would even go as far to say that my behavior may sometimes be considered asexual - even though I am not. Furthermore, the situation I am in right now (and who knows, perhaps also in the future) does not allow me to meet new people that easily, especially girls (I study computer engineering so yeah... lol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like this lack of experience also influences other aspects of my life. I don&amp;#39;t feel on par with most of the people my age. I feel a not-so-much adult in an adult world, alienated, left behind. This vicious cycle will eventually get worse and worse, as people go on with their life while things will get harder and harder for me to turn around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I tried to change things - perhaps not hard enough. I asked out a girl I barely knew via DM, she eventually said yes. This was my first date of my life. It went well, or at least it seemed to me, we laughed a lot and I personally had fun. But then she said she was not interested when I asked for a second date a few days later. Thing is, she is literally the only one I could have asked out that I somewhat know. This was one month ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I am in one of those periods in my life where I feel like this is not going anywhere. I hope it&amp;#39;s not true, but it&amp;#39;s been like this for all these years. The hypothesis that this may be my life until the end gets more and more realistic as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to therapy for most of my life - from when I was a child up until 2 years ago, when I was 21. I never had the courage to state that never having been in a relationship was a problem for me. It was something I was ashamed to express my desire of. In general, I never managed to talk freely about my problems there because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit therapy after realizing that, after all these years, I was not happy with my life. I agree that it sounds simplistic, but I also wanted to try and live without it and see how I would fare. I still am on my meds though (prescribed from a doctor).&lt;/p&gt;

So my parents weren't great during my childhood, which isn't anything special or unheard of. I didn't really have many friends throughout school, probably because I tried too hard to have people like me. When I got a job, I met a man who told me he loved me, so I clung to him because i guess i felt starved for attention.  

This took me through 3 years of abuse. I found he had cheated on me, that he lied and was actually 10 years older than I was, that he had three kids, and that he was an alcoholic. I have been through cigarette burns, had my rib cracked, my face bruised and my gums damaged, but the physical abuse really didn't shake me. 

The emotional abuse was what made me so codependent I guess. Fear of all the mind games. But I couldn't run away, as I had nowhere to go, and my parents decided I was a loser for my choices, which wasn't wrong. 

Then I met someone new, and I jumped straight into that relationship to get away from my ex. This new guy, let's call him Jim, he made me feel safe, so i quickly moved in with him. Jim treats me well, but theres no romance. He's too focused on his career, he's tired of having no money, which is understandable. The relationship is very one sided and though he is sweet to me, it feels like that's it. There's no more effort or passion.

He broke up with me a week ago. He says I'm too depressed, that he can't handle it. But I cant be alone and I'm so codependent I beg and beg. I've slept with him twice since we've broken up.

My parents are really critical of me so I have started avoiding seeing them and just spending my time in my room alone. Friends are all busy with work and university. 

I feel incredibly low. I have not left the house in 11 days now and can barely muster up the energy to brush my teeth and shower each day.

My mum just came in my room and told me I need to sort myself out. She finds it all pathetic and is angry at me. I get it. But that is not what I need. Can she not see that I am not well at the moment?

I also have been suffering with anxiety. Everyday there is something new to worry about. Yesterday I thought I had breast cancer, a couple of weeks ago it was cervical cancer, etc. Even applying body lotion to my arms I am scared I am going to see a dodgy mole.

I just feel so hopeless. But I get these brief moments of sadness when I think to what I was like this time last year. I was in university, surrounded by friends, top of my year, genuinely springing out of bed to go to university. I don't know how it went bad so quickly.

,depression_help,"There’s a tldr section at the end for those that don’t like long reads.

I know the first thing everyone is going to recommend is a therapist so don’t worry my first session is the following Monday, the 27th. I don’t like to view everything from a single point of view and I try to be open minded; especially about topics such as this one, and being self aware of my own thought process, flaws, and my counterintuitive points. Also some of you may disregard this because I just turned 18 but I guess that’s fine.

Here goes.

This is a recurring issue for me. Every single winter since about 5th grade, I lose sense of all emotion. I don’t know why, I hate it, it frustrates me to my core but of course I can’t really express that anger in any way. It hits me harder every single year. I’ll recover from it by mid-fall and then be perfectly happy by the end of fall and then solstice hits and I hate myself. I’m now in my final semester of high school now and I don’t know why I took so long to talk to my parents about it.

Of course I’m still a developing teenager; perhaps it’s just hormones? Maybe not. But either way: why would this happen every single winter? I very slowly recover every single year, but this time feels a lot worse. This winter I felt myself spiraling down before even getting to fall. During the last half of summer I actually got hit with this wave of self hatred, doubt, and utter disappointment in everything I said and did. But why? I tried drinking water, eating healthier, exercising every day, pretty much everything a (would-be) healthy person would do. But why could I not escape it? It’s like I’ve been dragged down into this pit where I can’t see the entrance I got pulled through. No matter how hard I tried I couldn’t stop this. All angst aside; I’ve been concerned for my mental wellbeing progressively more every day.

But some other things I don’t understand;

- I didn’t have a bad childhood.
I have a narcissistic mother, which everyone has to pretty much bow down to, sure. I’ve been mostly verbally reprimanded, minimal physical harm. Small issues often get blown out of proportion, and there’s typically a lot of yelling and unrest in the house. But nothing extreme ever happens. I’ve just been sad my whole life whether or not they tell/show me how much they love me. I suppose I often feel ridiculed but that could, again, just be my teenage mentality taking over.

- I’m in a happy relationship.
I have a girlfriend who is very emotionally supportive. She can tell when I’m overthinking things and often is much more showing of her emotions than I, despite having a much tougher childhood. When I’m around her, I’m usually happy and people tell me I smile and laugh a lot more when I’m around her. It isn’t fake either I genuinely feel a sense of happiness. Even when we’re separated I don’t feel entirely detached or sad because of the relationship. It’s more of a personal thing; but shouldn’t a healthy relationship block some sadness? It doesn’t though, I feel absolutely destroyed like I have no control over anything emotionally.

- I have a loving family.
They’re very supportive; sometimes there’s criticizing of my insecurities such as: me being underweight, not ever eating enough, shaking when I’m even the slightest bit anxious about anything (even if it’s unrelated to the circumstance I’m in.)

- I often try to help others more than I help myself.
I go out of my way to support friends that are talking a lot less some days, or if I notice someone wearing all black (unlike they usually wear). I’ll often give cliche tips like “drink water, eat when you feel comfortable with it, try writing about it,” etcetera. Additionally, I quite literally struggle to take care of myself in any way. Of course I shower, brush my teeth, eat (usually) 3 (usually small) meals a day, drink (some) fluids, and exercise a small amount each day; but to clarify, I mean I struggle to care about my feelings. I make far too much music, I write a ton, I draw quite a bit; but a pattern I notice is that everything I create has some underlying tone of sadness, depiction of struggle, or atmosphere of discomfort and self-hatred. All music I listen to has a message of either being sad, overcoming said sadness, being socially inept, overcoming fears, seeking happiness, feeling lost, stumbling in life, and breaching their own pain barrier to achieve something. It’s a broad spectrum but most of it is from an already lost or hurt standpoint and I suppose that also contributes to this overwhelming sadness.

Today I cried on the way home from school (I didn’t hit anyone thankfully), and I didn’t know where it was coming from. It was just this wave of “what am I doing here? I don’t feel I belong in my own home, they told me that themselves. I failed a quiz, and it’s only a week into the semester. Why do I feel so broken and inescapably drowning under my own unseen and uncashed pain?”

Notably, I see I spoke mostly negatively. Disregarding that, I don’t think my depression is validated. I don’t have the major symptoms like being excessively tired or loss of appetite.

- I’ve been underweight my whole life and I just got myself up to 124lbs which is still underweight for my height and age. I finished a whole plate of food yesterday for the first time in several weeks. I’ve always been a small portion eater.

- I sleep very minimal, likely developed some sort of insomnia by fucking up my sleep schedule so badly, but that’s undiagnosed so I don’t want to assume anything.

One thing I do have is a problem with sharp objects now. I keep sharp objects out of my room to prevent provoking myself or encouraging cutting. I cut myself “twice.” By “twice” I mean that I’ve only had two sessions. The first was a single cut. I didn’t break skin it just burned for a week. I told myself I would never do it again. It healed within 7-8 days. Here I am 4 years later (before New Years) and I’ve had a second session. This second session was much worse, I broke skin and continued slashing because I couldn’t feel anything and I just wanted to let myself be erased. I hated myself so much to the point I didn’t want to do anything but destroy myself. Those have healed quite well but took two or three weeks. My parents found out, asked me a ton of questions, I got the talk about being selfish and how ending my own life would affect everyone for a long time; which I already knew in the back of my head. But during that session I just didn’t give a damn about anything else but ending myself. I didn’t cry that night either I literally just lied down with my burning bleeding arm and went to sleep. They took me to the psychiatrist to get my physical health checked and to see if there was a solution to my underweight issue and never having an appetite. My psychiatrist diagnosed me with severe depression and said there’s nothing wrong with me I just need to try to eat more if I’m genuinely concerned about my weight. At the time I was 108lbs (135 is recommended for my age and height.)

I have an addictive personality (can’t stop myself from doing something even when people tell me it’s bad for me and give great backing evidence and reasoning), so I’d rather not take medication. I’m sorry if that offends anyone but I don’t want to psychologically become dependent on medication to help myself feel emotion when I hit these extreme mental lows.

I often have random breakdowns whenever I get by myself even if it’s just after someone has left the room. I had my worst breakdown ever on Friday, I cried and bawled for about an hour straight. Had to take 600mg of ibuprofen to battle the headache of lost fluids for that crying session.

Everything is kind of in random order so apologies for the disorganization I just need help understanding why I could possibly be sad, much more harming myself. Again it could just be that I’m a teenager with hormones, or I’m just an insecure pussy that can’t handle high school, but hell if I know. I don’t want this to continue into adulthood.

I’m seeking help.
But I’m still spiraling.

,depression_help,"Hello all! 
I am having a really hard depression and anxiety time and I’m also healing from about 6 years of increasingly severe chronic trauma and stress. I’ve got a couple of chronic illnesses (diabetes, asthma, anemia)So I’m a huge mess. 

I’ve been losing time. It’s been happening for a few years here and there and not such a big deal- normal. But it’s been getting worse. I have a job at a school and things are fairly regimented with periods and the day goes by. But when I’m not at work I feel like I have no concept of what time it is or how much time has passed. When I go to the store sometimes 2 or 3 hours pass and I have NO idea what happened.
I sit on the couch and get online and it can be 20 minutes later or 3 hours and I don’t know what I was doing. 
I got really nervous about it because I can’t seem to keep track of what day of the week it is lately and I forgot it was early release today and I didn’t set my alarms right and I didn’t even realize it was Wednesday til I was eating breakfast and looking at my email and saw the date. So I was 2 hours late to work. I felt so icky I just turned around and went home. 

What could cause such a loss of time tracking? Is that normal? I’ve never experienced it to such an extent before. Is this what depersonalization is?

,depression_help,"Hey guys 👋🏼 I’m new to this board and I was hoping to get some advice on how to not use food as a coping mechanism. I’m not big or anything, but I’m on track to be if I keep this up. I have major depression and anxiety and was just recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia (which fuels both of those further as part of the disease). I’ve been okay up until recently but I now can’t afford my medicine and have been eating more and more. Every time I think about going for a walk/run to try to combat it, my aching muscles discourage me and the depression drags me back to the couch or bed. 

My boyfriend and I just moved into his dad’s house to help him fix it up and the house is even more depressing.

I’m not big or anything, but I’m on track to be if I keep this up. I have major depression and anxiety and was just recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia (which fuels both of those further as part of the disease). I’ve been okay up until recently but I now can’t afford my medicine and have been eating more and more. Every time I think about going for a walk/run to try to combat it, my aching muscles discourage me and the depression drags me back to the couch or bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I just moved into his dad’s house to help him fix it up and the house is even more depressing. It’s in shambles and dirty but I’m determined to be strong for my boyfriend because I know how badly he wants to restore his childhood home back to it’s full glory.

**From the creator of: a short guide on showering. I’d like to proudly present “I haven’t taken out the trash in weeks and I’m fairly sure there’s a dimensional rip somewhere in my living room that’s spewing Lovecraftian monsters that hide under the pizza boxes”**

A short… well lets face it, these aren’t short- guide on housekeeping. Now I will start off by saying that a lot of this cleanliness stuff is based on personality. Some people just simply aren’t organized, it’s in their makeup. And that’s fine. Having clothes strewn out across the floor and not putting your shoes away is fine. Not polishing every dish you own with the spittle of Zeus himself is fine. What is squeaky clean for me will probably look like shit to any mother on the entire planet.

I realised that I had a Defcon 1 issue when I woke up one bright crisp morning, the air was still cool and the sun had yet to dance onto my green eyes. As I peeled myself off of my bed to go empty the sacred garden that is my bowels, I tripped, the melodic clink and clatter of energy drink cans sung forth a tune unlike any Disney princess had ever mustered. As I gently flitted-no- flitted is not the right word. As I gently parkoured across my bedroom amidst juice boxes and clothes that hadn’t been worn or washed a sudden realisation came to me. I had no way of showering. Gracefully I stumbled into my bathroom and noticed the bottles of red wine (Which mind you; couldn’t have been from me, I despise red wine, and the last time I had visitors must have been around 2 months ago….) and sat upon my throne, my eyes glanced upon 17 pizza boxes. Neatly piled one on top of the other in my shower cabinet. For the last 17 days I had ordered pizza every day because they came straight to my door so I wouldn’t have to leave my house. That means that I hadn’t showered in AT LEAST 17 days. 

And there goes crashing my beautiful illusion that I am an eloquently spoken lady. I, the writer of this, lived in a house that should be on some overly dramatic TLC special where the general public could gawk at me with a sense of pity. Like hoarders but then for pizza loving gaming addicts. My entire 50 m2 apartment looked like a war zone. I’m talking banana flies, I’m talking drain flies, Im talking energy drink cans and coke bottles and wine bottles and vodka bottles and… well a lot of bottles. when I finally took them to the recycling thing at my local supermarket I had about 120 euros in spending money. 

I hope that the people who may read this aren’t at the stage that I was. But I think as depression tightens its grip on the throats of our mind we can recognise the issues that I have so dramatically described. Dishes undone, the wheezing cries of a washing machine left untouched and unloved. Trash, piling up because leaving your house can become the most difficult thing you do during the whole day. And don’t even mention the SHAME. The utter disappointment in yourself as a human being.

Unlike showering or basic personal hygiene, this one isn’t as simple to put down on paper. I often heard and still hear on darker days that cleaning as a depressed person should eventually come naturally. We all know the advice “Pick a spot and spend five minutes cleaning it and ta-da you’ll be doing yoga and making creepy stay at home mum cleaning videos in no time”. If this has worked for you, fantastic. All the power to you. However its commitment and discipline which is so deprived in our minds. Sure it’s a great place to start. But where do you start exactly? Its not like cleaning is one of those things that you can solely focus on. From my perspective it involved every single fight that I had with my depression.

Where do you find the motivation to care? How do I leave my house? How do I manage my time? How do I not resort to escapism? How do I stop punishing myself for any small success or failure for that matter? How do I take the effort when I’m so fatigued even breathing feels complicated and too much? How in the ever loving fuck do I ask for help?

A lot to unpack here, but lets start off with some practicality.

Now this portion is geared towards people who live on their own, that’s where my experience comes in handy, but if you find it has merit to you whether you live with family, friends or your partner, then ill be pleased at my ability to relate to people. 

Procrastination is the best friend of depression. Its so easy to say “I don’t care, ill do it some other time” Or to mentally make a note of the trash you were supposed to take out and use it as fuel for self-loathing. “well look at you, you big lazy fucking nothing, that trash has been standing there for days and you’ve done nothing” is the thought while you walk past it because your body is on autopilot and your brain is trying to fight you. The first step you take is to acknowledge that thought. And I mean it physically. Stop walking past. Look at it, look at the dish or the trash or the vacuum cleaner you left lying on the floor that one time you did care. And then think about the thought you just had, or even the acknowledgement your brain gave you. “that’s trash, My brain is using that to punish me and honestly that doesn’t feel too great”. And then what you do, is you take the trash bag, and you take it to the trash. And when you’re done you can tell yourself that you’ve won that fight. Because that is what it is, a huge fight to rewire your brain that is withholding a necessary chemical from you, and you just kicked your brains ass. And if you cant do that, and this is the important part: Do not punish yourself. If you physically or emotionally are incapable of taking that trash bag and putting it in the trash, then what you say is “I cannot do it, but that does not mean I need to make a mental list of reasons why I’m worse than all the dictators in the world combined.” And you move on from that thought and compromise by doing something else. Lets say drinking a glass of water, or picking up your shoes, or gathering some laundry. Tasks in less than bite sized chunks that do not cause distress.

I know it may seem silly, and its going to feel repetitive to hear it, but its necessary to realise that you cannot punish yourself. Its also going to sound cliché to say “start small”. But its not about what you do, it’s about knowing that you’re doing it. Its about rewiring a brain that is hell bent on ruining you. A child will learn very quickly that fire is hot and that you probably should not touch it (except that one kid that ate glue and marbles, we all knew that little shit). That same new process needs to happen in the later stages of our brain when dealing with depression. Punishing yourself for every failure in an already cruel environment is going to hurt more than snorting a crayon. If you cant whip yourself into a frenzy and deep clean your entire apartment (I advise against it, the gusto you have will die down and then you’ll have left the vacuum cleaner in the middle of the floor again for another three months). Then wash a dish. One dish. Take one bag of trash out, clean up 5 food items or empty bottles or whatever off the floor. Gather 3 pieces of laundry and deposit them into the machine. dont even have to turn the thing on if that feels too much.

That is the beginning. That’s how to get started. There are plenty of guides out there on how to sustain it, how to grab momentum, how to Disney princess your way out of depression and into a clean home. But there are virtually no guides on how to start. Sure there’s stuff like “Clear your mind and focus on the positive” sure, all great and all, but I can barely look at myself in the mirror. “Find five minutes every day to organise a cabinet” Yeah I mean I could, or I could play a video game I don’t even really like that much for 8 hours straight, sad masturbate if I can muster it because nothing brings me joy and then hope the sounds of weird documentaries about the time when people ate mummies can lull me into a catatonic sleep. That’s my weirdly personal tangent over about that. Start small, learn what your brain says to you is probably horseshit, tell your brain to go sit in a corner and wash a dish. One dish, if you can find the effort to do the ones in the sink, then youre going to feel big boy dopamines hit you like a quarter tonne truck.

And now were getting to meat of it. I read somewhere a probably totally false claim that women will forget how painful childbirth exactly is because its in our best interest to breed and the trauma of pushing a baby out can really hinder that. That’s kind of comparable to how your brain works when its depressed. As soon as that rush of dopamine arrives, makes itself present, has a cup of tea and then leaves again for a little bit your brain will just forget that that dude ever visited and you’re back too feeling like the physical embodiment of a hangnail. Don’t let it do that. Do not let yourself forget that this happens. Don’t let yourself be lulled into the siren song of a brain that will fight your beauty every chance it gets. 

Now will this work every single time? No, probably not. will it work for everyone? Also probably not. Everyone is going to process things differently. But I believe that distancing yourself from the illness can be extremely helpful. By distancing I do not mean ignoring, I mean acknowledgement and acceptance. To realise that what is going through your mind in those dark days and moments and months and even years and who you are as an individual are separate. It does, at least in my experience grant a certain amount of power to realise that and you might find it helpful in your journey, as long and as arduous it may be.

Maybe not as coherent as the last one. I hope you enjoyed the read if nothing else.

I feel like I can’t admit that I’m drowning right now. I’m the happy person. I have no actual, tangibly bad things going on in my life. (Some work stress and worry over my mother’s health, but honestly, who doesn’t have that?) I have a wonderful, loving husband and great job and lots of encouragement from mentors about my “dream job,” which I’m working towards. Also, I’m often the sounding board for my friends and the few times I’ve tried to talk about how I’m feeling, it gets lost in talk about their issues and problems (which is fine, but it leaves me feeling uncared for/that my feelings are silly or unimportant). 

I am sliding into a hole and my normal techniques for getting out of them aren’t working. I KNOW these feelings are temporary. I KNOW these negative feelings do not have value and are “lies” told to me by low self esteem or whatever, but I’m really starting to lose my mind. 

If I’m not irritable, I’m really, really sad. If I’m not really, really sad or irritable, I feel nothing. Food tastes like sand. Any of my laughter feels forced and sounds like someone else is laughing. I mean, outwardly, I’m still bubbly and jokey and sweet, but underneath, I’m just this stew of fear, anger, dissatisfaction and paranoid thoughts that no one loves me (not true), that my friends are against me (also not true...well, maybe partially true) and that I’m running out of time to do anything with my life. 

I WANT to do something to take steps to feel better, but I feel paralyzed and powerless right now. I’m either over eating or under eating on any given day, but gaining weight because a) 45 and b) I’m WAY over eating and can’t get deficit on the days when I don’t eat....

On top of all of this, I recently lost a friend to a very violent, frightening, well-planned out suicide. He didn’t leave a note (which is sort of surprising for his general personality, but not surprising considering the manner in which he choose to depart) and it’s left me spinning. I didn’t go to his funeral or memorial service for some reason that I can’t explain. Truly, I guess, I just didn’t want to.

,depression_help,"Last year, I was really depressed and suicidal. I didn’t go through with my attempt, I met a psychiatrist, I had a break from my studies, and I was on some meds. Things seemed to look better. I still wasn’t that fond of living though, I was pretty much neutral about it; I wasn’t actively trying to end my life, but at the same time I made no efforts to improve it either. To put it in a way, I smoked, and I wouldn’t mind if the next cigarette would be the one to kill me, but at the same time I wasn’t actively trying to jump off a building or drive drunk into a tree.

Then I met the love of my life. My self-confidence was extremely low, and I never really loved myself, so when someone came to my life and actually loves me, hypes me, praises me, etc., I felt rejuvenated, like I had a reason to live, a goal to achieve. I want to repay her. I want to make her happy. And I want to live and love with her. I tried to improve my lifestyle. I quitted smoking for her. She made me love myself again. Or so I thought.

In the past week, or the past few days, we’ve been having some continuous arguments that lasted for a few days, and I’ve been noticing that my depression and suicidality would return, and sometimes I would even impulsively self-harm or say some things that I didn’t mean to. I realised, what if I never actually did love myself? What if she was the only one who loves me, and because I love her, I felt like I was loving myself as well? I also feel like she’s not only the main, but the sole reason for me to live, and that I’m dependent of her, and whenever we had an argument, I lost the will to live, I lost any self-love, and I would feel suicidal in the head, and would at times even self-harm myself. I even picked up smoking again in the past few days.

Is there any help or advices for my situation? I don’t want to burden her, or make her feel worried of losing me. I love her, and I know she loves me too, and I don’t want my mental health issues fuck over our relationship whenever we have an argument. Is there any way for me to love her wholeheartedly, without being totally dependent on her for my mental well-being?

&lt;p&gt;In the past week, or the past few days, we’ve been having some continuous arguments that lasted for a few days, and I’ve been noticing that my depression and suicidality would return, and sometimes I would even impulsively self-harm or say some things that I didn’t mean to. I realised, what if I never actually did love myself? What if she was the only one who loves me, and because I love her, I felt like I was loving myself as well? I also feel like she’s not only the main, but the sole reason for me to live, and that I’m dependent of her, and whenever we had an argument, I lost the will to live, I lost any self-love, and I would feel suicidal in the head, and would at times even self-harm myself. I even picked up smoking again in the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any help or advices for my situation? I don’t want to burden her, or make her feel worried of losing me. I love her, and I know she loves me too, and I don’t want my mental health issues fuck over our relationship whenever we have an argument. Is there any way for me to love her wholeheartedly, without being totally dependent on her for my mental well-being? Is there any way to fight or even just ignore the voices in my head that tells me she’s leaving me everytime we have an argument?&lt;/p&gt;

I know some people never know their real family, and I know life would've been so much worse without them, but damn, the ""tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all"" saying just doesn't feel right anymore. 

I wish that if my biological dad, mom, step dad, and brother would all be dead by the time I turned 25, that I had never gotten to know and love them and rely on them. 

Every paternal figure in my life has died. After my step dad killed himself, his best friend took over as my ""Uncle"". Within 3 years, he had a massive heart attack and passed away. After several similar occurences I've gotten superstitious about father figures. 

I have a full-time job, a fiancee, and pets. I want to be happy and hopeful so badly for them, but I just get so stuck and depressed. I feel like they should be enough for me, and I'm a burden by being depressed. 

I've lost so many friends over the years (it happens to high school and college I know) that it doesn't feel normal, and feels like my depression is driving them away. 

If I hadn't inherited a nightmare I might be ok, but my mom left me several cars (and an RV) that are all in disrepair and not smogged or registered. I look at them every day and cry, but I feel powerless to get out of here. 

I think there might be equity in the house, but I'm terrified of all the issues a home inspector might find when we go to sell. 

I'm falling apart and I just don't know what to do. I want to seek therapy, but I'm already paying a mortgage that's $1,000 more than I can afford every month. I'm drowning in debt. I need to get rid of those cars, but every time I try, something happens and I can't get it done, then I get discouraged and don't try anymore. It makes sense that if I'm wasting a ton of money just on my depression and not getting things in order that therapy is a worthwhile investment, but I haven't had good experiences with therapy in the past. I also know that if they look at my income it looks like I'm making plenty of money, so I don't think sliding scale would help. 

I don't want to die, but living takes way too much effort. That scares me, because I've heard that described as ""Passive suicidal ideology"" or something. I'm just so tired. I have no desire to do anything because I know spending money will make me have to work on selling the house even sooner. 

I don't know if I can ask the mortgage company to lower my payment while I work on selling, or what since the loan is in a trust. 

I don't even know what I'm looking for here, I've written this all in a journal a million times. I just needed to share this with someone, and this community seemed appropriate? I'm sure I'll get plenty of ""Go to therapy"" comments.

 I feel so guilty sharing my feelings. Everyone just says ""Oh, it's so unfair what happened to you"" and I know. I wish I could stop feeling sorry for myself even though I really don't have it THAT bad in the grand scheme of things. 

I just want to feel actual happiness again, and be able to not bring everyone around me down. 

Again, I'm not going to hurt myself(I truly don't think so). I haven't felt truly suicidal since middle school/one episode when I was 19/20 after my longtime girlfriend cheated on me and left me. I only attempted once when I was young. 

I know that I'm capable of getting through this, I am just in constant emotional agony currently. I generally consider myself to be logical and of a moderate intelligence, but I feel so stupid and irrational.

,depression_help,"Hi,

Just wanting an external perspective on this. So I’m a gay guy and I met someone at the end of October last year (on Halloween ha). We slept together first night and had been meeting up to do various things (movies, dinner, sex…) about 3 times a week since. Sometimes we’d meet like 4 days in a row and sometimes he was (apparently) busy for like a week and then can’t meet. I’ve met his friends and thought things were progressing. However, for the past week, he’d just been proposing like “friend” plans – going out for lunch, going to the gym, etc. Like last Friday, we saw each other at the gym and then he was like, so I'm going to spend the evening with my mother (which, by the way, I honestly think was true cause then at about 11pm he messaged saying it was in bed). We were talking about plans and trips together and I really did think things were going well.

He’s 41 and I’m 32. He’s never had a partner and says what I'm about to describe has happened to him before.

However, yesterday we talked as I had been seeing he’d been pulling away and he said there was something missing in the relationship. That he thinks I’m a great guy. He said when we meet he has a good time, but doesn’t feel the intense need to see me or passion. I said, it’s a shame and that I would liked to have continued to get to know him/that I really liked him and that as he's been pulling away gradually it's been difficult for me to really show myself. Then he asked if we could be friends, and I said I’m not at all sure of that. He also said he feels affection towards me and doesn't want to lose me. We hugged for a long time (with tears) and I left his house. We then texted later and he said he was crying and couldn’t sleep.

Do you think there is any chance of us starting to date again? If so, what do you think I should be doing? I feel so crappy right now.

,depression_help,"      I’ve had this fear of falling a sleep for 5+years now and I don’t have insurance so I have been using this loophole in my condition. At some point I will just pass out, so what I do is I stay up all night and choose the hour that I pass out on.

    This worked for a while. After New Years I fucked up and god forbid I had a little fun and stood up a little pass my engineered bedtime.

,depression_help,"I really need help on how to cope with losing a dependency in my life.

I've recently started University again. I dropped out of another one, because I couldn't adjust to the ""dorm life"" environment so I moved to live with my aunt and uncle, who also owned a dog that helped me cope with my decisions and made me less anxious to decide to drop out of my course (also bc i hated it). Anyway, I've started at a new university in a new city with a similar but much better suited course for me. I enjoy school and learning but my depression stops me from *actually* enjoying it. I live in a different country from the one I study at so I go home during the holidays.

The problem is, is that I've become very dependent on my dog. He would sometimes be the only reason I get out of bed in the morning and if he wants to go for a walk, I push away the *i don't have the energy to leave the house* out of my brain and take him for a nice long walk because it makes him happy. He loves spending time with me and we're inseparable, even though I'd be gone for months when I'm studying, we'll always reconnect. It's a huge problem because when I go back, I would regress back to feeling worse than before and less capable of looking after myself healthily. It doesn't help that I live alone either.

I've always had trouble adapting to new environments and the constant moving around is giving me whiplash and making my mind fuzzing; I've experienced depersonalisation before because of this. There is no constant being in my life that I can fully depend on and leaving my dog every-time I need to go back just hurts me more. I've realised that animals really help me to cope and improve my depression, and my therapist also recognises this. It's practically a blessing and a curse because even though it helps me, it's only short term.

Nowadays, my depression is worse because I'm just looking at the inevitable (I'm going back to study next week), I've tried not to cry and just enjoy the time I have left with my dog, but I'm still filled with dread of being alone again. It's not that I crave human interaction but just easy company and a sense of responsibility that isn't for me- but for my dog.

I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this? Do you think it's a good or bad thing to depend on an animal to get through your day?

But i know that thats not good for me. I know that i shouldn&amp;#39;t do it. But damn is it hard to resist to control myself ive been feeling empty again the cold, lonely emptiness. The emotionless pile of mess i really am. I can feel it creeping back and im scared&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I really don't know to where to start my mind is all over the place, I will try to keep it as short as possible. I am a PhD student in Canada I am on a Research assistantship (funding) and an international student. So my fees is fully paid by grant from my supervisor and I get a monthly stipend too.

Last year was difficult for me I had couple of tragic deaths in my family and had some other issues in life. I have never thought in my life that if I have depression or anxiety but over last 4-5 months my performance at work has significantly declined to the point where now I am not even able to work at all. I cannot focus, I cannot write, I cannot think straight. All I want/can do is to do nothing at all. I don't enjoy music, research, movies, my favourite sports anymore. And these are the things I am usually so passionate about.

I explained and talked with my supervisor about it and asked him to give me a few weeks off (unofficially). Because being an international student, if you take an official leave, you won't get paid and I am not allowed to work. So I took few weeks off but now I am realizing that it is getting worse actually. Because I am not able to focus there was a lot of work piling up in my life and now I feel more depressed, anxious whatever I don't know what it is. My main mistake in last 4-5 months was that I was not really accepting that I have a mental issue or illness. It may sound strange/weird but just when you get something mental related first time, it is very hard to accept for some people. Because of that mistake I was really trying to push things forward but I couldn't. Now I feel like I am in more deeper problems.

&amp;#x200B;

1) My supervisor is asking me about the work progress, because in the last meeting which was like 1 month ago I told him I am going to get better and I m feeling better so I will keep working and show you progress (i made promise not literally but made sure not to disappoint him). This was the time when I was going for mental 1-1 counselling and I was feeling a bit better about it. But I have got no progress.

2) Now I am at the stage where I really want to take an official medical leave (minimum medical leave at my university is for at least 1 semester). So that makes it 4 months. For that period my funding will be stopped but I am thinking to go back to my country for that time period to survive with my parents, take time off and get a full treatment.  

3) So technically if my funding is stopped for a semester I believe that grant can be on hold and I can start later - what I think is it should be no problem for my supervisor. But I am afraid now because I have pushed things a lot in last 4-5 months. I do regret that I should have decided to take leave earlier but I just did wrong. Now being heavily depressed and anxious, my confidence level at this point is below zero that I am even thinking from 2 days to reply to an email from my supervisor where he asked me progress. I know I cannot run from problems, I need to solve them. But I am just afraid, what if after sharing my intentions, I am fired? I have spent about 4 years already in my PhD. I have just 6-7 more months to graduate and finish. at this point I don't really want to lose my position and also lose my credibility in front of my supervisor. I just feel very bad about my own self and cannot find courage to just tell the straight truth to my supervisor.

I know this is not the place to seek this kind of help or whatever, but I just wanted to share and see if someone had been in somewhat similar position in the past? and how did you handled it?

,depression_help,"So Im 25 now, and I just feel like I havent really experienced life at all. Ive got an education but I havent got any real friends, just lots of acquaintances with no real connection. I feel like Im someone who could just disappear and no one would know. Ive never had a girlfriend, never really even had any girl I liked or had a crush on. I never had those experiences at school or as a teenager that I can look back on fondly. Im just going through life because its what you do, when Im doing Uni work in the back of my mind is always the thought ""why am I even doing this?"". I just feel so tired.   


I dont want depression to take everything over. I want to change things. It just seems so insurmountable to me, I feel so far behind everyone else. When I think about it, the idea of going out there to make meaningful connections with people living their own lives at high speed seems impossible, especially as Im in my twenties. And from what Ive experienced its not something you can force, being that friend in the group who could stay or go is painful when you know how little you matter to these people you're clinging to. It all just feels surface level (or maybe its been so long since Ive had a real friend that I forgot what it felt like). I feel like years and years of this has made me so guarded of anyone that the mere thought of any emotional intimacy with anyone fills me with anxiety. And at this point I feel like my personality and enthusiasm have been killed off to the point where Im not all that interesting to talk to most of the time.

I am going to see a new psychiatrist after 1 year and a half(almost 2 years) of not seeing my old psych and taking on and off sertraline and trazadone not prescribed by a doctor, I don't want to encourage anyone to do that, it was pretty stupid and out of my mind, I could be even in a worse state right now than I was before. My story is the next one: I was diagnosed with deppresion with psychotic features in September 2017 and been hospitalized for almost a week(5-6 days I believe), before I went to the psychiatric hospital, I went through one of the worst symptoms and state of minds I have ever been in my life since then, couldn't sleep, couldn't stop thinking and worry about my life, decisions, about the past, what I've could do to be better in University, what I've could do to not get so invested in the the girls I have been dated and not get so hurt, all these things together made me psychotic and really deppressed , I didn't knew the term psychotic or I was too afraid to look into before  I was diagnosed. 
Everything felt like hell, almost destroyed all my friendships during that period. Let's get back to September 2017 : in September 2017, I was put on medication since the first day I was hospitalized in this psychiatric hospital in Romania, where I live. I felt better from the first day, then after 6 days I went home. I have seen the psychiatrist every month untill the start of April 2018, where I started to get deppressed and psychotic again probably, and decided that I don't need the medication anymore(that decision was also influenced by a trip on acid that made me think that I don't need the pills anymore. The next months were horrible, I started smoking weed again and been worse than ever, then in September 2018 I moved to UK where my brother lives, because I thought that changing everything will change me as well and will be better(new country, new people, etc).I was actually wrong, the anxiety of being away from home hit me like a truck and started to be in the worse anxious state of my life. 
Started taking the same medication for 3 months prescribed from my GP, knowing the diagnosis and knowing the meds, not sure if it was a great idea without seeing my psych and talk about that, but it worked and everything was okay again, felt normal and motivated, got a new job and started thinking about my future more than before, started talking again with my friends and texting to girls. In January my GP couldn't prescribe me the meds anymore, then everything was bad again. Started abusing weed and other drugs, still had a job, then changed the job to a more stressful one, worked there from April 2018 to December 2018 while my mental health was getting worse and worse, lost weight, started looking worse, been mocked by co workers, been disrespected all those things made me almost suicidial. 
Now I am back at home and will go to a new psychistrist on wednesday because my old one has appointments all January, and from February won't be working anymore in that clinic.


What should I talk with her, I feel a little bit better now but still can't go out in public and be in social situations because last time I had a panick attack and almost left my workplace and then depersonalised/derealized myself and started feeling like everyone was talking about me and mocking me, I had these symptoms for 3 days, then calmed myself at home , been on edge and I still am in this present moment, pretty anxious and thinking about what people are talking about me.",t2_3ed9fas,False,,0,False,Seeing a new psychiatrist on wednesday,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING SUPPORT'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_eo58nw,False,dark,,public,17,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING SUPPORT,False,17,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1578956627.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the title sums up pretty much the subject I am going to discuss about .

Started abusing weed and other drugs, still had a job, then changed the job to a more stressful one, worked there from April 2018 to December 2018 while my mental health was getting worse and worse, lost weight, started looking worse, been mocked by co workers, been disrespected all those things made me almost suicidial. 
Now I am back at home and will go to a new psychistrist on wednesday because my old one has appointments all January, and from February won&amp;#39;t be working anymore in that clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should I talk with her, I feel a little bit better now but still can&amp;#39;t go out in public and be in social situations because last time I had a panick attack and almost left my workplace and then depersonalised/derealized myself and started feeling like everyone was talking about me and mocking me, I had these symptoms for 3 days, then calmed myself at home , been on edge and I still am in this present moment, pretty anxious and thinking about what people are talking about me.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't control what I think, I can't tell a person why a crime is wrong, because child abuse is wrong I have no idea why rape is wrong I don't know, I came to imagine without wanting naked people or me doing wrong things, this with people of all ages, family, I started imagining people horribly without their eyes, this is not normal, me doing something against them I think, I wished the ""devil"" would kill my mother, I think I even prayed for that, I watched some violence movies and thought a lot about killing, actually 2 movies and a series a few years ago, I'm afraid I'll have to kill myself to not cause any harm, I'm a mistake . I guess I just didn't kill myself because I can't do that. I mean I'm 17 years old, 17 useless years. I came to love life but couldn't live with what's inside me, every time I'm happy, remember my pathetic life and get sad. I have sociophobia I can not communicate with people without anxiety, by email it is all easier. I don't know why but I started to hate certain members of my family for wanting to have better people, I don't know what happens, sometimes I think it's all an illusion that if I kill myself I'll break free of this illusion, I even started a blog to report these things in poem form, but I wouldn't want to expose myself for not wanting to influence people you know? When they find out about me they'll want me dead. I THINK I should have several psychiatric disorders not? I don't know if it's any use asking you for help :( 

   
there is something else, I started to think all normal my will how to deal with me in the future, all normal and I, the freak, I started to believe in reincarnation because of wanting to be happy and love life, I already wanted to have children but I thought what kind of woman would get a freak, so I thought my dna sucks I don't want my kids with that. and another thought for not liking my parents do not want a child with this blood. then I thought what kind of person will be

,depression_help,"School is tomorrow and I feel myself sinking deeper and deeper as the day goes on. I don’t want to go, and I don’t really know why.  But the thing is, I don’t want to stay home either. I don’t really know what I want, and I don’t have a choice. I have to go to school. 



I guess I don’t want to go to school because I don’t want to fake the smile. I don’t want to wear the mask of “I’m fine”. But if I don’t, people will worry and ask questions in a bad way. I know what happens if I take the mask off. People will see my tears and the hurt in my eyes. They will see how bad I am feeling. If I say how I truly feel right now, they will send me to the hospital. But if I leave it on, I will break. I can already feel it happening. I’m stuck both ways.

It’s been like this for months. My school is amazed at how great I’ve been doing, being happy and all. But they don’t know it’s all fake. I’m broken inside. I have nobody to turn to. My mom just doesn’t understand and my dad has been believing in the smile.

Not a hug from my dad who thinks I’m always happy. I want a hug from somebody who knows how much pain I’ve been for the past months, no. Years.

&lt;p&gt;I guess I don’t want to go to school because I don’t want to fake the smile. I don’t want to wear the mask of “I’m fine”. But if I don’t, people will worry and ask questions in a bad way. I know what happens if I take the mask off. People will see my tears and the hurt in my eyes. They will see how bad I am feeling.

,depression_help,"Some backstory: I have been in a depression for about a year now. It stems from last January when I was on the medicine Vyvanse for my ADD. I was prescribed to take 2 20 mg pills every morning, for a total of 40 mg. At some point, the psychiatrist or pharmacy switched the amount per pill, so I was being given 2 pills by my dad still, but the pills were now each 40 mg, and i was supposed to only be taking one. I'd always had my dad manage my medicine for safety, so that I never abused it, but in this instance he didn't notice the mg change and this went on for about 5 months, and it messed me up. I was essentially taking amphetamines and getting all the side effects with none of the benefits, but had no idea. It made my second semester of senior year, and my previously promising forensics season, a living hell. Eventually I noticed the mistake when my dad had to leave early one day, but by that point it was too late.

I fell into a really bad depression from all of this. We switched doctors and I was prescribed a new medication, but it gave me bad stomach aches and gave me flashbacks to when I was being overdosed, so I rarely took it. 

That caused my first semester of college to be equally bad, I basically had no motivation, I dropped two classes I was failing just because I wasn't showing up. The work itself was easy, but it was actually trying to care about it that presented an issue. I couldn't get out of bed for days at a time. 

Going into the next semester, my dad recently gave me a lecture about how he dealt with his depression. His answer to it was just ""getting my ass out of bed"", aka, just ignoring it. I dont think my dad's depression was as bad as mine is, as he just can't fathom having days that you cant be motivated but I have them regularly. He wanted me to promise him that I would never have another day where I didn't get out of bed and I refused to make a promise that I'm not sure I could stick to. I mean, I am now on medicine I take regularly, but I dont think that's enough to guarantee I'll be ok every single day. He then accused me of seeing myself as a victim of depression and just using it as an excuse for being lazy or not wanting to do things. 

Maybe I should just be able to just get out of bed and get to studying. Maybe I'm the asshole because I'm just still mad at my dad for the medicine incident and funneling my anger from that into this.

I have tried several times ti get out of bed and clean myself and clean my surroundings and respond to calls and messages. Every time I try to move it is like something heavy and dark is pulling me down. Some force greater than gravity. I can’t move. 

I feel absolutely disgusting and I smell horrible. You can imagine what you’d smell/feel/look like after 2 months of not cleaning yourself. I can taste blood in my mouth which I am assuming is my gums bleeding from not brushing my teeth. I know how awful this is. You don’t have to tell me. Even with all of this...I am still unbothered. I suddenly don’t care about myself at all and I am wondering what happened to me. 

I came home from a work trip 2 months ago, threw my suitcase on the floor in my room and just went to bed. Haven’t gotten up since. Never even unpacked. I have since lost my job because I just stopped showing up. 

Now I am living in a filthy room due to my neglect. There are dirty clothes all over the floor...I can’t even see the carpet anymore. Food...leftovers...wrappers...junk all over the place. Roaches I suspect due to the leftover food. I don’t care and that’s the worst part. 

I only eat one small meal a day. I don’t even need to step on a scale to see how much weight i’ve lost. I can feel my skeleton. 

I can’t cry even when I try to. I feel completely void of emotion. 

But I want to change. I want to move forward with my life but this weight I carry is so heavy...I am so overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to get done...thinking about all the effort and energy (I don’t have) that it’ll take....

&lt;p&gt;I have tried several times ti get out of bed and clean myself and clean my surroundings and respond to calls and messages. Every time I try to move it is like something heavy and dark is pulling me down. Some force greater than gravity. I can’t move. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel absolutely disgusting and I smell horrible. You can imagine what you’d smell/feel/look like after 2 months of not cleaning yourself. I can taste blood in my mouth which I am assuming is my gums bleeding from not brushing my teeth. I know how awful this is. You don’t have to tell me. Even with all of this...I am still unbothered. I suddenly don’t care about myself at all and I am wondering what happened to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home from a work trip 2 months ago, threw my suitcase on the floor in my room and just went to bed. Haven’t gotten up since. Never even unpacked. I have since lost my job because I just stopped showing up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am living in a filthy room due to my neglect. There are dirty clothes all over the floor...I can’t even see the carpet anymore. Food...leftovers...wrappers...junk all over the place. Roaches I suspect due to the leftover food. I don’t care and that’s the worst part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only eat one small meal a day. I don’t even need to step on a scale to see how much weight i’ve lost. I can feel my skeleton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t cry even when I try to. I feel completely void of emotion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to change. I want to move forward with my life but this weight I carry is so heavy...I am so overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to get done...thinking about all the effort and energy (I don’t have) that it’ll take....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so tired. God...I am so damn tired. 
Please...someone help&lt;/p&gt;

I worry about her, so I can&amp;#39;t sleep as well.
I have a girlfriend, and now she ignores me as well. I have no idea what to do. We live in two different countries, so seeing each other is not that easy.

I’ve looked at myself, and after blowing up tonight, I’ll go and see a psychiatrist ASAP.

I’ve never been an overly happy person, but I’ve always been a reasonably nice person. A caring person. The last few years have changed me.

,depression_help,"I’m not depressed, I have been in the past but not right now. I do however have ocd and add, the add is pretty bad but the ocd can be rather mild. I’m a sophomore in high school, I left high school for independent study about two weeks after the semester started because of grades, and depression, so I’ve been spending way to much time inside. I did get a job at baskin Robbins in November so that helps me stay social, I’ve also been in a relationship w my girlfriend for the last 4 months. But other than that I don’t talk to anyone. I realized very quickly I have no real friends. Maybe 1 or 2, but I don’t really think so. It’s starting to get worse, even though I go to work, and talk to people, everything just seems off, and I don’t know how to explain it. I get extremely paranoid at night, thinking someone will break into my house and kill me, I also have to check the locks multiple times before I got to sleep, and lock my bedroom door. My dreams are extremely vivid, and sometimes I can’t tell them from reality. I live in my own little world in my head, so the outside world is just foreign. I was doing okay, but I smoked a shit ton of pot from November to December, and right after I quit I did a 3.5g shrooms trip w molly which partially traumatized me, and made me way more empathetic and sensitive, but when I was smoking I was high literally all day everyday for an entire month. I lost full contact with myself because I was high all day everyday. I almost completely destroyed my relationship with my girlfriend by never talking to her and almost cheating on her, and I still hate myself for it. I feel like I’ve lost mostly all touch of who I am as a person. I recently started skating because I want something I can pour myself into to escape and that helps. But I feel like everyday I drift farther and farther away from the world. I also believe I’m not going to live much longer. I wake up and think of a future and there is nothing there. Im not going to commit suicide, because I’m not depressed, but I feel like I’m gonna die of natural causes or something soon. Sometimes I wake up and think there’s something wrong with my body, like I have a disease that’s gonna kill me, and I feel like I should go to the hospital. I’m probably dealing pretty heavily with a dissociative disorder or something like that. My mood swings heavily, I’ll feel great one moment, and depressed the next. I was technically diagnosed with “cyclomythia” but I don’t even believe It because he just diagnosed me off what I said. I had a dream the other night that somebody died, and I’m starting to think what if it happens, and I saw in a dream this person died, and I feel like I’m loosing it. I don’t really know what to do, I’m constantly confused, and constantly paranoid about people I care about dying. I also get really scared that at some point I’m gonna break, and go completely insane and never come back. I just don’t really know what to do. Oh and by the way my apologies my grammar is shit right now, it’s 1 am and I’m hella tired, normally I’m pretty well spoken or eloquent or whatever, I just don’t feel like talking like that rn.

I do however have ocd and add, the add is pretty bad but the ocd can be rather mild. I’m a sophomore in high school, I left high school for independent study about two weeks after the semester started because of grades, and depression, so I’ve been spending way to much time inside. I did get a job at baskin Robbins in November so that helps me stay social, I’ve also been in a relationship w my girlfriend for the last 4 months. But other than that I don’t talk to anyone. I realized very quickly I have no real friends. Maybe 1 or 2, but I don’t really think so. It’s starting to get worse, even though I go to work, and talk to people, everything just seems off, and I don’t know how to explain it. I get extremely paranoid at night, thinking someone will break into my house and kill me, I also have to check the locks multiple times before I got to sleep, and lock my bedroom door. My dreams are extremely vivid, and sometimes I can’t tell them from reality. I live in my own little world in my head, so the outside world is just foreign. I was doing okay, but I smoked a shit ton of pot from November to December, and right after I quit I did a 3.5g shrooms trip w molly which partially traumatized me, and made me way more empathetic and sensitive, but when I was smoking I was high literally all day everyday for an entire month. I lost full contact with myself because I was high all day everyday. I almost completely destroyed my relationship with my girlfriend by never talking to her and almost cheating on her, and I still hate myself for it. I feel like I’ve lost mostly all touch of who I am as a person. I recently started skating because I want something I can pour myself into to escape and that helps. But I feel like everyday I drift farther and farther away from the world. I also believe I’m not going to live much longer. I wake up and think of a future and there is nothing there. Im not going to commit suicide, because I’m not depressed, but I feel like I’m gonna die of natural causes or something soon. Sometimes I wake up and think there’s something wrong with my body, like I have a disease that’s gonna kill me, and I feel like I should go to the hospital. I’m probably dealing pretty heavily with a dissociative disorder or something like that. My mood swings heavily, I’ll feel great one moment, and depressed the next. I was technically diagnosed with “cyclomythia” but I don’t even believe It because he just diagnosed me off what I said. I had a dream the other night that somebody died, and I’m starting to think what if it happens, and I saw in a dream this person died, and I feel like I’m loosing it. I don’t really know what to do, I’m constantly confused, and constantly paranoid about people I care about dying. I also get really scared that at some point I’m gonna break, and go completely insane and never come back. I just don’t really know what to do. Oh and by the way my apologies my grammar is shit right now, it’s 1 am and I’m hella tired, normally I’m pretty well spoken or eloquent or whatever, I just don’t feel like talking like that rn. If you have any suggestions on what I could do that’d be appreciated. Thanks. I hope anyone reading this is doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"This is kind of a rant, kind of a request for help. I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, this was typed on mobile while hiding it from my parents.

Today, I feel the worst that I have in a while. I think it's all the stress getting to me, with midterms coming up. My parents keep yelling, being exceptionally irate, and just fly off the hook for no reason.

For example, I was upstairs in my room reading. My mom is downstairs, and me and her are yelling back and forth. It's not an argument, we just have to yell in order to hear each other. This would have gone fine had my dad not interrupted. He started yelling about how I needed to show more respect, how I was using an incorrect tone, and other stupid things. 

Earlier, my mom was telling me to do my homework. I had already prepared for an upcoming Science Olympiad competition, done an entire P-SAT test for practice, and was working on writing a speech for a club that I'm in. I just said,""I'll work on it later."" Clearly, having worked 5 out of the 6 hours that I'd been awake so far *didn't qualify me for some free time.* She just yelled at me, saying I was being lazy, and that I could do my homework quickly and finish it today.

A few problems with this:
1- It's a 14 page packet. I have already completed about 5, but no way is it physically possible to complete before sleeping
2- It's being graded for accuracy
3- I had other work to do, and plus, it's due on Tuesday! I'll have plenty of time between tomorrow and Monday night to get it done!

I tried explaining, but to no avail. In the end, she stomped off, saying,""Well, don't ask me to play your games until your work is done.""

This kind of stunt that my parents pull of *really* pisses me off. Ever since I was little, my parents put quotas on my work. I had to finish all homework, even on a Saturday, before I got to play video games. I also have to ask my parents before I get to. I've tried to take it without asking, but that just resulted in a beat-up, crying 4th grader (little me), and a massive scratch and paint chip on my 3DS.

Now, this might seem trivial. A little electronic device shouldn't be my only source  of happiness. Except it is. You see, I've always been shy and not had many friends. At this point in my life, those few friends have either betrayed me or have become close. Even so, I don't see them that much. The only thing that's been a constant companion to me, from when I was younger to now, 8th grade, has been my love for games. 

They're literally my only escape from trouble. When I feel pissed off, like beating something up, I just grab my 3DS and relax. Anything I can play makes me feel better. 

But this brings me to another thing, that concerns me more: I can't find pleasure in doing things anymore. Earlier, I would play something and it would leave me almost supercharged with happiness. But now, it doesn't even take my mind off if what's around me. The moment I stop, everything comes crashing down.

Okay, okay. I know I've been spouting nonsense, and I'm sorry for wasting your time, but does anybody know anything at all that would help me?

I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, this was typed on mobile while hiding it from my parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I feel the worst that I have in a while. I think it&amp;#39;s all the stress getting to me, with midterms coming up. My parents keep yelling, being exceptionally irate, and just fly off the hook for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I was upstairs in my room reading. My mom is downstairs, and me and her are yelling back and forth. It&amp;#39;s not an argument, we just have to yell in order to hear each other. This would have gone fine had my dad not interrupted. He started yelling about how I needed to show more respect, how I was using an incorrect tone, and other stupid things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, my mom was telling me to do my homework. I had already prepared for an upcoming Science Olympiad competition, done an entire P-SAT test for practice, and was working on writing a speech for a club that I&amp;#39;m in. I just said,&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll work on it later.&amp;quot; Clearly, having worked 5 out of the 6 hours that I&amp;#39;d been awake so far &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t qualify me for some free time.&lt;/em&gt; She just yelled at me, saying I was being lazy, and that I could do my homework quickly and finish it today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few problems with this:
1- It&amp;#39;s a 14 page packet. I have already completed about 5, but no way is it physically possible to complete before sleeping
2- It&amp;#39;s being graded for accuracy
3- I had other work to do, and plus, it&amp;#39;s due on Tuesday! I&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time between tomorrow and Monday night to get it done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried explaining, but to no avail. In the end, she stomped off, saying,&amp;quot;Well, don&amp;#39;t ask me to play your games until your work is done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of stunt that my parents pull of &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; pisses me off. Ever since I was little, my parents put quotas on my work. I had to finish all homework, even on a Saturday, before I got to play video games. I also have to ask my parents before I get to. I&amp;#39;ve tried to take it without asking, but that just resulted in a beat-up, crying 4th grader (little me), and a massive scratch and paint chip on my 3DS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this might seem trivial. A little electronic device shouldn&amp;#39;t be my only source  of happiness. Except it is. You see, I&amp;#39;ve always been shy and not had many friends. At this point in my life, those few friends have either betrayed me or have become close. Even so, I don&amp;#39;t see them that much. The only thing that&amp;#39;s been a constant companion to me, from when I was younger to now, 8th grade, has been my love for games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re literally my only escape from trouble. When I feel pissed off, like beating something up, I just grab my 3DS and relax. Anything I can play makes me feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this brings me to another thing, that concerns me more: I can&amp;#39;t find pleasure in doing things anymore.

,depression_help,"Hi everyone,

I don't know if this is the right sub for this and if not, i'm deeply  sorry because i know there are people here who are in pain and need your help more than i do.

Let's tell you a bit about me for the matter at hands: for as long as i can remember, i've been a books guy, when other kids would go play together during school breaks i would just go sit somewhere and read. My father is a history fan, especially WW2 and i grew up hearing stories about soldiers, visiting museums in normandy and watching war movies.

Today i'm 23, married, two dogs and i just finished a series of intensive web developpment courses. The next step is finding an internship and getting a job as webdev.

But...

I feel like everything's pointless, i spent my life reading about people doing things that matters and now im supposed to just get a job so i can spend hours doing something that i don't like that much (still the professionnal activity i like the most of all the ones i tried so far) just so i can make it to the next month? Is that really all there is to life?Am I to just waste my entire time working and try not to get bored the rest of the time?

So i guess what i'm asking is: has anybody here found the answer to that question?

I am stuck in life and can't move forward. I am currently living with my mother, younger brother and younger sister. I don't get on with them, they aren't any kind of support network. It's not an exageration to say most of my mental issues stem from my family.

,depression_help,"So my partner and I moved countries roughly five months back.  I have settled reasonably well. 

He is struggling a lot. In our previous country he left a job of four years which towards the end was toxic. When we arrived I went straight into work and I have always been the bread winner. 

He took the first temporary minimum wage job he found. He hates interviewing so when this job landed in his lap he was keen. Three months on and he is hating the environment- the company is paying him minimum wage for a job which his permanent peers are earning 3 to 4 times as much and he is being treated like he is permanent in an extremely pressured environment.

We both took the decision that he quit and take the time to find something which is right- study, another job or some form of entrepreneurial venture. I have been continually reinforcing that he can take his time and use this opportunity to find something he finds fulfilling. 

Honestly we won’t struggle in the slightest without his salary. However he is feeling pressured despite my  repeated affirmation that he will be seen to be using me and leeching off me. 

I may be putting some pressure by asking him what his plan is, however I have never not had a plan plus backup ever. So I struggle to comprehend his predicament. 

I see him slipping into what I would say is depression- constantly tired, sleeping a lot, poor eating habits (both of us), stopping all exercise (both of us) and being constantly  irritable- we have fought more in the last six weeks than our entire relationship.

There are environmental factors as well- we missed summer completely this year, there is a lack of day light versus home and we are struggling to make any friends.

,depression_help,"Hi, sorry i still dunno how reddit work yet. I just joined and it's  my first time talking about such stuff online. I've been diagnosed  with depression and few other stuff few years ago and i had treatement and such until i felt better but whenever i got into an argument with family i could feel it crawl back in me. Up until now I've  been strong enough to overcome those small situations. And even tho i feel better most of the time i can feel it whenever i'm sort of reverting back to it. Like i start to go out less and less, i stop talking to people online and irl and answering the phone becomes a hard task.. then i start to distract myself by bingewatching shows so i don't leave space to thinking, i don't/can't sleep at night and i have a hard time remembering things i just did or dont realize I've done them. And i like  reading but it becomes hard like i can't focus and i end up skipping lines or read without remembering/understanding what i just read. The more i stay home the harder it is to get out. Anyway that's how i know shit is getting serious. Other than that i sometimes have a hard time swallowing food the doctor said it was anxiety a lack of magnesium and having supplements did help but anyway. Two days ago came back home i was in a good mood i brought sweets for everyone at home except i fould out novody was there. I have a kitten at home i brought it recently about two months ago. it's  5 months old and it still pees in the wrong spots when it's  far from its litter. The past few weeks it peed 3 times on my blanket and i had to take it get cleaned everytime. I barely got to use it so this time i had put it in a closed room so the cat cant get to it. But a cousin of mine opened the room to feed the cat there and my father had taken away the litter out of the room because that's  what he does .. whatever he likes basically. Anyway when i came back i found the door open and pee on the blanket that i had just taken out of from cleaning a night before and put aside away from the cat but there it was dirty again. I got mad. And i couldn't get angry at anyone. I felt like even when i did my best to avoid something it happened again. And i burst crying pretty dramatically.. i felt devastated. I mean i know it's a ridiculous way to react but i went from good day to worst day ever for a stupud reason in no time and i couldn't  stop laughing for a while. I guess i felt frustrated or idk but i kept muttering stuff and couldn't  stop crying. And when i calmed down about half an hour later i was worried i had reacted this way before when i wasn't  feeling well but i didn't think id react that way now. I thought everything was fine. Now i just don't know if i really am. The only reason i can think of as the source is that I'll be taking classes again after almost a year now I've failed my last high school year twice in the past when my depression  was really bad and after that and therapy i felt good enough to study again i stopped highschool  i chose a different institute i studied for two years and my grades were good for the two years ive been studyingi passed the final exam but half way through the end year project i just gave up. I don't  know if i can blame my mental health for it or if i just turned into a self sabotaging  person or just that it wasnt what i really wanted to do bur i was driven by the fact that i dont have a choice so i just did it. After that i stayed out of school for about a year doing half time jobs and now i want to try something different again. I'm  afraid that's  the cause but i don't  want it to be i just wanna finish what i start this time. This thing is already going on for too long. I'm  not sure what I'm  asking you here. But i guess i want an opinion or advice. I'm worried i can't tell when I'm  not ok until symptoms get physical and how am i supposed to deal with that.. what if it affects how i deal with stuff negatively  and I'll  only be aware of it when it's  too late.

,depression_help,"I was an art director in advertising for many years and left because of just the twisted bullshit from the companies I was working for. Wealth disparities, the fact that I had to walk down an infamously drug-addicted/homeless street in a large city to get to this ad agency where tech companies were shelling out $$$$ to advertise on Facebook. It ended up destroying me, so I left, and went on a journey. I got sober (2.5 years booze/weed-free today). I've had the adventure of a lifetime, along that 2.5 years I found myself, I found others, I travelled a lot, I created so many wonderfully beautiful things and faced so many of my fears. 

But I am here now, and I don't know if it's the weather or because I haven't connected much to the people in the city I know live in -- but I'm super depressed and it's not going away. I went to Japan and studied product design for a few months and spent a lot of time in department stores. The amount of just CRAP that was produced and sitting on shelves gave me an anxiety attack about a month in. And that memory of so much waste is triggered every time I walk into a grocery store or past any store with a window installation. If I go into, say Trader Joes, and see all the displays/packaging. I think of all the Trader Joes in the world, multiplied by how many grocery stores/buildings, multiply that by EVERY DAY, and I am just at a loss for words and sanity about how much we're wasting and being destructive. I think that my footprint is just killing other animals and environments and because I've done so much in my life, it's just easier to take myself out and not deal with the /reality/ of what I'm doing by being alive. 

I don't find humans to be special snowflakes, there's 7.5 billion of us with the capacity to grow even more. Everyone (at least in the US) is brought up culturally to see themselves as unique and special and they are told to change the world and find purpose, but it's like -- by keeping ourselves alive we're destroying so much. 

I try to distract myself from it by making art or playing music but I can't help but sit there and think -- here's another waste of resources to keep me alive for the sole purpose of just entertaining other people who do, what exactly? 

I don't think people should have more children (I don't want kids). I think we're at a place where there are so many un-parented foster children/orphans in the world that whenever I hear my friends bring up that they want kids I just get frustrated and think they're selfish. I've tried really hard to understand and realize that maybe it's my own inner resentment to me not having a partner/house/etc but it's really not (I literally had to end things with someone who was probably the sweetest thing on the face of the planet because I was not doing very well mentally).

I remember feeling a tinge of disgust when he told me travel stories, which 2 years ago I would have found inspiring and amazing, and now I'm like -- so? you paid money to become scuba diver, you paid money to go to college, you built a website that brought you a lot of income, and then you traveled some more. Who. Fucking. Cares. and I'm almost ashamed to say that I am kinda the same way. I have been ""featured"" on a lot of shit that I used to think was impressive and now I think is just dumb. Maybe because working at an ad agency was the easiest route to get a big media buy. IDK --  

Maybe this is another case of PAWS, but I just am so unsure since it's been a few years. I spiral down so quickly. I can't get it out of my head, like I just can't unsee the department stores. I can't unsee the pictures of the landfills. I can't unsee the data. I guess maybe it's just depressing? As soon as it happens nowadays I try to divert my attention and go do something else, but literally anything I've bought is kind of a trigger (at least currently). I don't know what I should do about it. Maybe move into the woods and get away from it all?

I&amp;#39;ve tried really hard to understand and realize that maybe it&amp;#39;s my own inner resentment to me not having a partner/house/etc but it&amp;#39;s really not (I literally had to end things with someone who was probably the sweetest thing on the face of the planet because I was not doing very well mentally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember feeling a tinge of disgust when he told me travel stories, which 2 years ago I would have found inspiring and amazing, and now I&amp;#39;m like -- so? you paid money to become scuba diver, you paid money to go to college, you built a website that brought you a lot of income, and then you traveled some more. Who. Fucking. Cares. and I&amp;#39;m almost ashamed to say that I am kinda the same way. I have been &amp;quot;featured&amp;quot; on a lot of shit that I used to think was impressive and now I think is just dumb. Maybe because working at an ad agency was the easiest route to get a big media buy. IDK --  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is another case of PAWS, but I just am so unsure since it&amp;#39;s been a few years. I spiral down so quickly. I can&amp;#39;t get it out of my head, like I just can&amp;#39;t unsee the department stores. I can&amp;#39;t unsee the pictures of the landfills. I can&amp;#39;t unsee the data. I guess maybe it&amp;#39;s just depressing? As soon as it happens nowadays I try to divert my attention and go do something else, but literally anything I&amp;#39;ve bought is kind of a trigger (at least currently). I don&amp;#39;t know what I should do about it. Maybe move into the woods and get away from it all? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ll go out on a run now.. /sigh/&lt;/p&gt;

I have a good family, I live in a good place, and I look fairly good. Everything is ""good"" but something still seems to be missing.

It's not uncommon for me to believe that I'm worthy of nothing. Whenever I'm home alone, suicidal thoughts keep appearing and they insist those words in my ears: ""it's okay. That (suicide) will solve all your problems and no one would care anyway!"".

You thought I was almost giving up, right? Well, NO!

I've been reading several self-help books, blogs, articles, and so on. Nothing really helped me, though. I'm taking anxiety medication, but despite the huge dose, it doesn't seem to be working. But I'm not giving up.

In the next month, I'll go to another city hoping for a good start for my life (I'm almost 18 and still live with my parents), and I don't know how I'll react in that new environment. Maybe it will be good for me (let's be optimistic).

I'm trying to be a better person because that seems to be one of the few things that could bring me any joy in my actual state. I'm drinking more water, meditating, drawing, meeting new and inspiring people, and other great long term habits.

Now I’ve been sober for 3 years. I try to do yoga, meditate, cbd, breathing exercises, painting. Those are temporary things. I feel alone like I’m in a dark hole all the time. My job is very social. I do hair so I’m talking to people all day and they have no idea. My family doesn’t really know and my fiancé doesn’t understand it. I’m not sure what I’m looking for I think it’s just nice to let someone know.&lt;/p&gt;

I have anxiety disorder. My relationship with my mother is complicated and with my father is a so-so. It's normal in my culture that we don't directly express our feelings, so that is one of the reasons the feeling of unloved and self-doubted go all along with me through my childhood. I have a brother, when we were kids, he was the kind of student who got A for every tests while I was trash. I knew I had my own talents, it's just not in the fields which most of people are obsessed with, like Maths or Science, or Business. My mom rarely had time to spend with me, so I always felt like she was so disappointed with that she ""finally accepted the truth that her daughter was trash"". 

I was not. I tried so hard to get a compliment from her, to be regconized, but so far everything I remember is just nothing. I was bullied in high school, which made my social anxiety worse, I doubted everybody and tried to keep a distance with everyone. I wondered if I pretended being ""normal"" so well that no one noticed me, or no one really even cared. Anyways, when I passed the examination for college although I did not do my best due to unfortune, so for me, I still passed because I was good, but for my mom, it was lucky. She made it a joke to tell our relatives, like ""Thanks God that she passed the test, it was so lucky because if it was only 1 point lower, she would have failed by now"". It. Hurt. Me. Real. Bad. And I went mad everytime. It just hurted me really bad, especially after all that efforts, and at that moment I remembered many years before that, when I passed another examination for high school, she did the same joke: ""Thanks God your brother has taught you that question the day before and then that question surprisingly showed up in the test"".

Damn it. 

Last year I went study abroad, yes, my mother paid for that. I was like, ""if it's too expensive, it's fine, I don't need it"" but mom and dad just insisted. I have gained some confidence while studying abroad, and again, I started thinking about a plan to earn a job, money and society status, just to gain her compliment. 

But you know what? January 2019. She died. Of cancer. She hid me her condition. 

My mind was blank. All I feel is mad. Even by now, everytime speaking of this, I get mad. I barely had a mom through my childhood, I had to figure out all the female things during puberty, I taught myself how to use a pad/tampon, I taught myself to put on my first lipstick. I had lived like a teenage boy. 

For God's sake I don't blame her or her tragic destiny, but her love has also shaped the demon inside my mind. She just simply hurted me and I know, vice versa, I hurted her. It's just, our loves tasted so damn bitter. 

I have tried so hard. I speak fluently 4 languages by now. I can draw, I can paint. I can make beautiful handmade crafts. I can play the piano. I have translated many novels. I have read many books.

Depression physically rewires your brain over time. This might be the case for many of us who have been chronically and severely depressed for many many years.

It only gets progressively harder to fight depression with a brain that becomes more partial to depression everyday.

Any treatment recommendations that focus on rewiring the brain and not just treating chemical imbalances?

\----------------------

:: Full version ::

I've been aware of this for some time, but only in the aspect of improvement. Practice makes perfect.

In psychology, we learned the example of the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is responsible for spatial memory, of taxi drivers and the observed physical changes over time as drivers improved in their ability to memorize maps of the city they were driving in everyday. Another example was the changes in the brains of medical students during the span of their education, which enforced memorizing large quantities of information regarding the human anatomy, biology, and chemistry.

**Negative thoughts, the resulting anxiety, and overall depressive behaviors that persist in someone who is chronically depressed also rewires the brain and conditions it to be even more and more ""perfectly depressed"".**

**What little hope, motivation, and optimism we have is dwindling every day that we are depressed, and yet, this is our equipment to fight a stronger, more invigorated depressed brain.**

**We are using a brain that becomes more and more partial to being depressed everyday... to fight depression. How paradoxical is that?**

I think this is the case for me and many of you all.

I know of medication and therapy (eg CBT) to be two common treatment methods, but...

CBT requires huge effort on part of the patient to actively and methodically develop healthier thinking. Persistence and motivation is required from someone whose primary symptoms are a lack of those qualities. It's an arduous process depending on the severity of depression. 

And medication, while effective (IF you can find the right one), treats chemical imbalances.

I don’t really have many friends but the ones I do are really good ones. My family is a little messed up though. They all care about me i know they do but my parents divorced so that makes things difficult. 

I’ve been struggling to socialize lately and leaving the house is starting to seem like a dreadful concept, as if the effort would kill me. I have all these emotions built up inside me that can’t and will never come out, even if i try. I haven’t been truly happy or comfortable  in a very long time.

I work at McDonald’s in the kitchen and standing over a grill for 8 hours can be a little much. Sorry if you’re still reading this im almost done. 

But besides all that anytime I try to get help or talk to someone I immediately end up thinking about how I would be bothering them, or how this isn’t there problem, or they shouldn’t have to deal with me and i cant seem to let out my emotions no matter how hard i try.

Slicing my arms open just to be able to breathe again for a second and then telling everyone it was just to piss my parents off when the school got involved. Getting three hours of sleep a night for all four years of high school because if I stayed up and made sure the house stayed clean, and then skipped school and kept it clean, then got my work at the school and worked on it all afternoon, maybe they’d love me. 

But they didn’t. They never did. No one does. The only people who ever cared about me was the 60 year old grandfather of my best friend, who the thought of can turn my stomach and make me sick in seconds after what he did, and the 30 year old who said he just wanted to help, until he put his hands on 12 year old me. And you know what? They wouldn’t even care anymore. I’m too old for them now. 

I make everyone miserable. My boyfriend, my parents, my siblings. I’m just a fucking disappointment. I’m tired of not being good enough. Tired of being completely and utterly alone in this world. I should have just killed myself when I was sixteen like I promised myself I would but there he was, saying he loved me, making me think that maybe it wasn’t me who was the big problem. But I am. It’s always me. He hasn’t loved me for a year at least. Wrote out a break up letter and left it beside me while I was asleep except I never even got it. And I just went about thinking he still loved me but I was just alone. 

I can’t do it anymore. I’m tired of having what happened to me as a kid bouncing around in my head like a ping pong ball. Tired and trying and trying and trying for everyone else only for them just to remind me what a piece of shit I am. I know I’m useless. I know I’m a piece of shit. I know all I’ve been my whole life is a place for someone to stick their dick in. I know you’ve hated me since the day I was born. What did I do to deserve to have everyone hate me?

Everyone would be better off without me. The fights will stop because I’m not here to start them, right? Everyone’s lives will be better because the fuck up will be gone.

,depression_help,"Hi, my name is Delaney, so for some background... I'm 14 and an only child, I'm female and always have been called mature for my age. Ok so the whole idea of taking medication came into my mind in about November of 2019, I was in my first ever relationship and at first thought I was happy, I had a really nice boyfriend, we took things slow and were really good about talking to each other about everything but... after a little I started to get this feeling that something was wrong. Whenever anyone would invite me out I would get super anxious and moody. I never wanted to do anything but I forced myself because I had commitments. I couldn't just never hang out with my boyfriend and friends so I pushed through. It was like that for a while and it got to a point where I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend because it gave me too much anxiety with the thought of even being around him. I broke up with him in October of 2019 and since then everything seems to just be going downhill.

One day I remember getting home from school and no one was there so I just started pacing throughout the house blabbering about everything horrible going on, I couldn't cry and I felt like I had so many built-up emotions that I needed to get out so... that's when I started cutting myself. I did it because it made all of my emotional pain physical and I had control over how much of it I felt. It helped actually and I started to get this 'numb' feeling. I enjoyed it at first but then the high kinda faded. I just sorta dealt with it for a while and recently it's gotten worse I feel like all of my friends hate me and I'm super annoying, they all will make small comments and they'll really get to me. I'll get horrible mood swings and even my friends have mentioned that I seem to only have two moods that I switch between throughout the day. I have a super hyper and happy attitude and then I have a really quiet and moody mood. my insomnia has also gotten really bad, I'll spend around an hour just lying in bed playing through scenarios in my head and bashing myself over things I did wrong that day. I recently took a bottle of alcohol in hopes it'll help me in some way but all it did was make me feel sick and even more... I guess scared would be the word. I hate sitting down and actually thinking about things, if I start to think about it too much I'll start to lose the meaning of anything and then just freak out because I don't know what to do. I'll yell at myself for not doing my homework and not allow myself to relax leaving me in this constant state of uneasiness. I also can never commit to anything, I always seem to give up and it's ruining me, I'm scared I'm gonna wake up one day and realize I've waisted my life worry and thinking.

I&amp;#39;m 14 and an only child, I&amp;#39;m female and always have been called mature for my age. Ok so the whole idea of taking medication came into my mind in about November of 2019, I was in my first ever relationship and at first thought I was happy, I had a really nice boyfriend, we took things slow and were really good about talking to each other about everything but... after a little I started to get this feeling that something was wrong. Whenever anyone would invite me out I would get super anxious and moody. I never wanted to do anything but I forced myself because I had commitments. I couldn&amp;#39;t just never hang out with my boyfriend and friends so I pushed through. It was like that for a while and it got to a point where I ended up breaking up with my boyfriend because it gave me too much anxiety with the thought of even being around him. I broke up with him in October of 2019 and since then everything seems to just be going downhill. My anxiety started getting even worse and I felt so lonely, it didn&amp;#39;t help the fact that he convinced me to try and still be friends.

,depression_help,"Hi. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any issues. I've never even looked at this sub, I just needed to find something because I have nobody to talk to so I used the search bar. I've never admitted any of this out loud. I've never typed them to anybody either, just in the memo section on my phone, where I keep a diary in case I end up killing myself. 

I'm not technically suicidal, I'm not trying to find ways to kill myself. I just want something to happen to me so I can just die. I'm currently on a road trip with my kids (two sons, ages 3 and 1) and my parents. We're on our way back to our home state, my husband is there. I want to get out of the car to pee or something at a rest stop and get hit and die on impact, I don't want anything to happen to my parents or my kids.

I've been having thoughts like this for a long, long time while walking or driving alone. I never have them when I'm with other people. 

I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD from childhood trauma, and have gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on an anti-depressant (Zoloft) but had to stop as it was causing me to have stroke symptoms. 

I feel like none of my friends give a shit. I'm aware this could be my mental illness telling me this, but I can't help it. Nobody ever asks me how I'm doing, and I ask them every day. I message or call them immediately after they post a concerning status on Facebook, check on them on anniversaries of loved one's deaths, etc. Nobody asks how I'm doing unless I stop replying to them for over a week (which I have done twice over the last year by muting all notifications from messaging apps when I'm particularly depressed and can't handle anything else). When I post in group chats about something I'm done or my sons have done, I feel like somebody always has something happen right then and whatever I've shared gets ignored. I've stopped telling people about my life and venting, and nobody has asked. 

Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment.

Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, it's just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress.

I've thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I haven't. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. I've attempted before (when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago). I don't want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance.

I can't help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like I'm just being used, like I'm a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if I'm ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I don't want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just can't help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like I'm enough, I guess. I don't even know if this makes sense.

,depression_help,"I'm unsure if this is the right sub for this, if not I would love to be pointed in the right direction. Could I also be recommended other subs for this post, I just want to be sure I get good help.

I am feeling worried because I have exams for the 15th, 21st, 22nd and 23rd of this month, and I have barely prepared for them and I fear this will stay true. I fear this because a week ago or so I thought about studying and hoped I would do that but I only studied for one day. I am not thinking about failing my exams, I think it's because if I do study I'm sure I'll do well. Would it be possible for someone to help me take the small initial steps I need to get enough good learning done? That one day of study I had was just me in my bed watching recorded lectures, and it was good, so I feel I don't need to take many steps, or large steps. I feel like it would be helpful for me if the idea of studying in my head is tangible. There are times when I truly believe it will happen, but then I'd use that belief to do something else that's productive, and then the willpower I'd have at moment will be lost. So would it be possible if I get checked up on from time to time to see if I've wandered off too far? 

I'm unsure if this additional information will be helpful. I basically live in my bed due to comfort, but I think it's hurting me. I'm not really driven to do simple things consistently, like taking care of myself hygienically, or searching for things I find enjoyable, but I can at least feed myself. But I don't really care for fixing that, but maybe it's part of the problem. I just want to study.

,depression_help,"It started in November of 2018, (back when I was a swimmer) I was up late one night with my gf (about 2:45) and we were starting to get a little frisky. We moved the conversation to Snapchat and that's where it all started, she asked me to send a pic so I did... What I didn't realize was that I had also mis-clicked and got one of my closest friends too. The next morning I woke up to a phone full of texts. All I was reading were messages from my friend group saying ""wtf is wrong with you"" and ""how could you do that to her"" (my close friend was a girl. Also in the swim team with me) by the time I had realized what happened she had told everyone, even the team captain who took it to the coaches and had them kick me from the team. After that everyone who called themselves my ""friend"" completely abandoned me. Blocked me on everything they could find and basically cut me from their lives. Naturally I was furious, because at the same time the people who were my ""friends"" started slandering my name saying I did a shit ton of stuff I didn't do. Some of it was true but the majority of it was a lie so big and perfect, worked on by at least 10 people in collaboration that nothing could get through. About 2 weeks later my grandfather passed away and left a scar on my family that eventually healed and faded. A couple months passed and it was January of 2019 and a lot of hope to put everything in behind me, I couldn't stay in my house any longer than I had so I took to the internet to find a sport and what I found was a blessing. I found the Buldogs rugby team. I went on to play rugby for the spring and we won the state championships, when summer rolled around I found myself working in a construction job, you might be thinking ""yay he came back from everything and got a new sport and job!"" But what I don't know was that my ""friends"" had never given up on making me miserable. About halfway through the summer they struck again claiming they were going to take me to court for sexual harassment, (I personally didn't think they had the guy to do it)  they never did but for the rest of the summer that's all I could think about, getting everything together to fight back, but what I wasn't prepared for was the emotional and psychological damage it would cause. I ended up being depressed and on the verge of unstable the rest of summer and the beginning of fall. Until that blessing came back for the fall season it went about the same as spring and we walked out with 2nd place at the state tournament. After that started the anniversary of 2018, it was November again and the ""friends"" were back at it again. They tried to convince my gf (same one a year later. Still don't know how she's put up with my bs) that I was cheating on her and flirting with one of her best friends which started another spiral and I was going to crash hard. But one of the few lights in my life caught me, my grandmother. Now grandma was a very nice woman as long as you were on her good side, she sat down with me one day and asked how I was and I opened up to her and told her what was happening between my school, (which was spiraling faster than my mental health) rugby, and ""friends"". She helped me through it and just when it felt like it was over she sat down with me again and asked me to promise her that I would walk the stage and graduate in 2020, I did and I wanted to fulfill this promise with everything i had in me. But just like clockwork she passed away just a couple days before Thanksgiving, I had never been more upset about anything in my life, I had called her just before she went to bed asking what was for lunch the next day. Part of me blames myself for it because if I had stayed on the phone just a little bit longer I probably could've done something. And I started another decent into darkness. this one was different, I could see and feel myself slipping but didn't have the energy to do anything about it, I started seeing it affect my school, my sports, my faith, and relationships with the people around me. It's like I burnt out, had no purpose anymore, I just put on the mask and went along with the flow. December came and there was no Christmas at Grandma's house, i had that feeling that everything would be different. It was the first time I truly felt alone, I felt like there was no one to turn to for help, the rage I had turned into lust that filtered into rage and I took out some of it on my gf making her cry and making me feel more and more like horrible person.

&lt;p&gt;[09/01, 20:33] Chloe: Theres only one way of escape that my mind cant stop thinking about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09/01, 20:35] Chloe: I&amp;#39;ve been trying so hard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09/01, 20:37] Chloe: I really just want to leave the house and go sit somewhere in the dark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09/01, 20:41] Chloe: I have told the psychiatrist too much and they legally had to tell certain things to my parents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09/01, 20:42] Chloe: So my mum would expect a suicide attempt as soon as I left the house&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09/01, 20:44] Chloe: Yeah&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"You know the feeling. You wake up feeling blah. You start thinking about all the stuff you have to do today, you’re under pressure at work, the kids are fighting in the kitchen, your SO is picking on you because you didn’t take the trash out, and so on. 

You’re now in a downward spiral and you’re feeling worse by the minute.

STOP! 

You don’t need to do this. You don’t need to feel this way. Here are five easy keys to change your mood and guarantee you’re going to have a much better day. So follow me here:

1) take one minute, quick! to *think of* *three things you can really appreciate* in your life right now. Maybe it’s the warm bed you’re in that you don’t want to get out of. Maybe it’s the smell of coffee from the kitchen. Maybe it’s the fact that one of your coworkers complimented you on something yesterday. Maybe the skies are blue outside today. Just pick something, anything! It’s not a contest, and let yourself truly be thankful for that for 20 seconds, without any thought to the past or the future, then do it again for two more things. Come on, let’s go. Do it now. I’ll wait.

2) all these worries that are swirling around your head are about the future, right? The truth is *you have no idea what’s going to happen*. You could get run over by a bus when you walk out the door. That would change everything, wouldn’t it? You could also get a call from your doctor today saying hey, lucky you, the tumor is benign, you have a new lease on life. The thing is, it’s all in the future and really and truly you don’t know what’s going to happen. So stop thinking about it and think about how delicious that cup of coffee you’re having right now is, because at least that’s real!!

3) Still feeling crappy? Grab a pen and a paper and *start writing all the reasons why your life sucks*. Keep going. Don’t hold back. When you’re done, go back to the top and start arguing with yourself, like this: Yeah, OK, my boyfriend sucks, but he did fix my car yesterday, so that was pretty cool. I hate my job, but my boss is really nice and it does make the boredom less unbearable. The dishwasher is broken, but hey, at least I have a dishwasher! I can get it fixed! It’s not the end of the world! And last time I checked I still could do the dishes by hand. Keep going like that and your mood will lift up several levels.

4) Put your attention on something external. Instead of looking inside at all your perceived problems, *think about what you can do for someone else.* Get up and go kiss your kids and tell them you’ll buy their favorite cereal tomorrow and they can stop arguing now. Drop a little note to someone whom you know for a fact is in a dire situation. Maybe they feel suicidal. Maybe they’re really sick. Tell them you love them and you’re thinking about them and sending warm thoughts over. Not only will it completely change their day, but believe it or not, it will change yours! Or give a dollar to the homeless guy at the corner and while you’re at it, smile at him and tell him you wish him better luck. Try it. You might be surprised to find that your shadows lifted.

5) get up, get dressed and *take a quick wal**k* around the neighborhood. Look around. Look up at the sky. Take three big breaths. Smile at people for no reason. Even if it just feels like a smirk on your face, do it. Studies have shown that pasting a silly grin on your face, moving your shoulders back and looking up will actually alter your mood in a positive way. It’s so simple! 

Go do it now, and get back to me. I’m curious to know what worked the best for you and what didn’t. I’m cheering for you over here!

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

,depression_help,"I feel very lonely...

Been moving around a lot (Between Nicaragua and Canada and then between a couple provinces in Canada) and finally decided I wanted to stay somewhere. I decided to stay in my home city but it's been a while since I lived here and my old friends are either not here anymore or not interested in being friends anymore.

Life was ok but slowly declining as I was having 0 social time outside of work yet every other part of my life was actually going really well (stuff like keeping my house clean, getting lots of sleep, getting the non sleep rest time, etc.)

Then I messaged an old friend who I didn't know very well (but I once gave her a bottle of tequila I didn't want). Her and I started talking and we got very close. She is the sweetest girl I've ever met and as per usual for me I got attached way too quick.

Fast forward a month and a half, it's the week of christmas and she's not talking even an 8th of the amount that we used to message and she eventually says she needs some space.

Turns out her ex that broke up with her was in town for christmas and because of very awkward living situations she was living with his parents so they spent christmas and new years together while I literally cried on new years while hiding in a corner at a party. She didn't talk to me at all until the day her ex left.

He broke her heart again. And she broke mine.

This all accelerated my slow decline to a drop off. And it didn't help that I also got sick for the first time in years during the hardest of this all.

It's hard because it's all because of a slow build up and the situation with the girl was only the straw that broke the camel's back. That makes it feel all so insignificant compared to other people's problems that they are struggling with. My ADHD doesn't help either.

And now I'm here... I had a taste of what it felt like to be loved and cared about even to the point of being pursued at times (which felt great!) And I wouldn't trade the good time for anything. Bit going back to my terribly lonely life where the only constants are my evenings alone watching netflix and my office at work, it's really hard.

I feel as though I've been constantly suffering rejection from romantic interests, potential friends, and people I thought were my real friends too.

I struggle with being able to read more subtle social cues because I lived in Nicaragua for the first 3 years of High school and was home schooled and that messed with my understanding of Canadian culture and different types of people that I haven't been around lots are extra difficult for me to read.

How does one even make friends? What is it that makes me so undesirable that people never want to stick around long? What is it that I can't see and no one will tell me? Who would really care if I died? Maybe people would be relieved I'm not bugging them anymore.

,depression_help,"Hey Reddit community, this is my first post. It will be kind of a doozy so please bear with the lengthy context, id appreciate you reading the whole thing...

My sister (18) is really depressed and unmotivated because of it. She lives at home with our parents and so do I (for the time being, I just graduated from University and am searching for a full time job); I'd appreciate some advice on how to help her.

TLDR; depressed sister with unhealthy habits, I seem like I am getting nowhere with my efforts to teach her positive and healthy daily actions.

Background:

-She has been going through severe depression and anxiety for about 3-4 years now, she lives at home and works a retail job (about min wage) less than full time. Left college in the middle of the semester due to anxiety. Living off my parents basically.
-My parents kind of let her do what she wants, this means hanging out with her friends almost every day, and going to her very messy room as soon as she gets home, laying in bed, and doing nothing but browse apps on her phone.
-she is (outwardly) ungrateful and does not recognize or acknowledge all the family is doing for her (trying to help)
-I know she smokes weed frequently and drinks alcohol and vapes sometimes, I've told her this will only make her depression worse, but she says ""smoking weed is the only thing that helps""
-spends ALL her money from her job on weed, eating out, and whatever else consumable, frequently pays for her friends to do stuff (I know this is probably a misguided attempt to keep them around)
-her friends don't drive, and are probably in similar situations to my sister (I don't think she should hang around with any of them from what I've heard, but everyone needs friends I guess, they are probably what has kept her going this far)
-flakes out on therapy appointments and isn't consistent about taking her medication or rescheduling said appointments- says therapy ""doesn't help"", I've told her that my therapist says ""the real work is done OUTSIDE of therapy, therapy just brings it all together""
-when I say ""doing x will help"" (from personal experience) she says she's ""tried everything and nothing helps"" (she doesn't try everything, at least not enough to form positive habits)
-she doesn't have a plan, at low points she has said her plan is ""to kill herself"" (nothing specific)

My parents don't know the first thing about dealing with someone who is depressed, and having gone through less severe diagnosed depression myself and coming out of it motivated through hard work on my part, I feel like I am the only one in the family who can put in proper effort to help her.

How I've been trying to help...

-being positive overall, ""you can do it"" ""I love you"" etc
-telling her that she has to put in the work to improve her mental state
-telling her to drink lots of water (I end up bringing it to her half the time)
-telling her to consume more positive media, like watching shows instead of browsing the mindless Snapchat discover section and Instagram feed
-telling her to quit smoking and drinking, because I know first-hand that makes it worse- *edit - I also tell her to let me know if she needs anything, that she can talk to me, etc

I know I shouldn't let this effect me as much as it does, but I am really concerned for her (if she doesn't change her habits willfully I am convinced she will commit suicide at some point) and feel like I need to show her the way of leading a healthy lifestyle and habit building, because no one else is doing so (at least not her friends), and she isn't motivated at all for self-improvement or to get better. She is very unreceptive to any advice and doesn't even make eye contact when I talk to her, she just doesn't care.

How can I help to motivate her?

It will be kind of a doozy so please bear with the lengthy context, id appreciate you reading the whole thing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister (18) is really depressed and unmotivated because of it. She lives at home with our parents and so do I (for the time being, I just graduated from University and am searching for a full time job); I&amp;#39;d appreciate some advice on how to help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; depressed sister with unhealthy habits, I seem like I am getting nowhere with my efforts to teach her positive and healthy daily actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-She has been going through severe depression and anxiety for about 3-4 years now, she lives at home and works a retail job (about min wage) less than full time. Left college in the middle of the semester due to anxiety. Living off my parents basically.
-My parents kind of let her do what she wants, this means hanging out with her friends almost every day, and going to her very messy room as soon as she gets home, laying in bed, and doing nothing but browse apps on her phone.
-she is (outwardly) ungrateful and does not recognize or acknowledge all the family is doing for her (trying to help)
-I know she smokes weed frequently and drinks alcohol and vapes sometimes, I&amp;#39;ve told her this will only make her depression worse, but she says &amp;quot;smoking weed is the only thing that helps&amp;quot;
-spends ALL her money from her job on weed, eating out, and whatever else consumable, frequently pays for her friends to do stuff (I know this is probably a misguided attempt to keep them around)
-her friends don&amp;#39;t drive, and are probably in similar situations to my sister (I don&amp;#39;t think she should hang around with any of them from what I&amp;#39;ve heard, but everyone needs friends I guess, they are probably what has kept her going this far)
-flakes out on therapy appointments and isn&amp;#39;t consistent about taking her medication or rescheduling said appointments- says therapy &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t help&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;ve told her that my therapist says &amp;quot;the real work is done OUTSIDE of therapy, therapy just brings it all together&amp;quot;
-when I say &amp;quot;doing x will help&amp;quot; (from personal experience) she says she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;tried everything and nothing helps&amp;quot; (she doesn&amp;#39;t try everything, at least not enough to form positive habits)
-she doesn&amp;#39;t have a plan, at low points she has said her plan is &amp;quot;to kill herself&amp;quot; (nothing specific)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents don&amp;#39;t know the first thing about dealing with someone who is depressed, and having gone through less severe diagnosed depression myself and coming out of it motivated through hard work on my part, I feel like I am the only one in the family who can put in proper effort to help her.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"
Me being a 20 y/o Junior in college, my mental health has gotten so much worse over the past couple of years. Last semester was the hardest I've ever gone mental boom and with Spring semester coming up I'm dreading it. 

Last semester I literally failed all of my classes not because I was dumb, but because I just didn't go to class and do the work. It's weird because I know that if I don't do the work I'm not going to pass, but every time I try to do something I have no motivation. It also doesn't help that in the same semester I got into a car accident that I caused and it totaled my car that I had for FOUR months. Not only that, but we didn't end up putting full coverage on the car because I told my mom I would try to find a better deal with another insurance and of course I forget to remind my mom and the accident happens a month and a half later, so the car is a total loss.  

The thing is that I feel like I've been dealing with this since high school as during my senior year I would fake sick just because I didn't feel like going to school. I wasn't being bullied; I had a very good amount of friends. I just had no motivation to go. It got to the point where my parents were taking me to see doctors just for them to tell my parents what I already knew: There was nothing wrong with me. 

I guess the most infuriating part about all of this is I don't know the root of the problem, but I have too much social anxiety to go talk to someone and fix it. I've talked to my girlfriend about it and she thinks I got it from when my parents were arguing and I had to hold my mom back from my dad in elementary school (yea sounds bad I know) but they've divorced and crack jokes with each other now: I could care less about the divorce. But also I had a horrible relationship with my step mom AND mom in my teenage years. With my mom, the police were called a couple of times. I'm rambling but the point I'm trying to make is it's so frustrating knowing something is wrong but not know how to fix it, and also not knowing how to get help.

,depression_help,"*Warning graphic*

My name is jeffrey and tonight I am finally going to finish what i have started multiple times before. All my life I have been told that my life is worthless and that I am not meant to be on this earth. I am 16 years old and i have tried to commit suicide 3 times before. So here's my story.

I was born on April 12th 2003 to a mother and father who were only 18 Years old. Neither one of them wanted a child but could not afford an abortion. I was born into a low income family that made its way to lower middle class. From the time i was 5 years old and could understand conversations my parents have told me that i was never actually wanted and that i do not deserve to live. I have also grown up not being able to show any emotions because as my parents say ""if your not supposed to be here and you are your Damn well not gonna show emotions"". For 8byears i have been perfect at hiding my emotions and reactions to things. My parents have never supported me in anything. 

Fast forward to the age of 10. I meet my first drug dealer in the road way and for the first time someone supports me and i start to deal a little drugs but i also begin to use. Drugs such as weed, crack cocaine, and other things like that. One night the police bust me dealing and i end up serving a 6 month sentence in juvenile hall. I know no one and I am a loner there and i show no emotions. When i get out my parents take me home and beat the shit out of me for getting arrested. At this time i was too young to understand dyphus. As the years go on I believe my parents more and more about my life being worthless and me being a useless piece of shit. To relieve myself of all the negative thoughts i begin to abuse drugs more and more and stop dealing to start using only. After a few times of getting busted and going back to juvenile hall I begin to feel like i am going no where. 

Fast forward to present day. I finally get a boyfriend and he's perfect. Issue is he lives 500 miles away so not much he can do to help me. Bes made me happy but not happy enough after all these years I have been diagnosed with depression and due to the fact that my father loves weaponry i have an arsenal of guns in my houses basement. So why is this important you ask? Because i plan to take as many rounds of  ammunition that i can and kill my parents and then text my boyfriend one last time that i love him go into the center of town and fire into the air until the police officers shoot and kill me.

This is my story and i am not sorry that i have told it. I am also not sorry for what i am going to do. Please feel free to use my story as a reference to avoid this kind of behavior in parents there is so much more going on than you all know in everyone's life.

&lt;p&gt;My name is jeffrey and tonight I am finally going to finish what i have started multiple times before. All my life I have been told that my life is worthless and that I am not meant to be on this earth. I am 16 years old and i have tried to commit suicide 3 times before. So here&amp;#39;s my story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born on April 12th 2003 to a mother and father who were only 18 Years old. Neither one of them wanted a child but could not afford an abortion. I was born into a low income family that made its way to lower middle class. From the time i was 5 years old and could understand conversations my parents have told me that i was never actually wanted and that i do not deserve to live. I have also grown up not being able to show any emotions because as my parents say &amp;quot;if your not supposed to be here and you are your Damn well not gonna show emotions&amp;quot;. For 8byears i have been perfect at hiding my emotions and reactions to things. My parents have never supported me in anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the age of 10. I meet my first drug dealer in the road way and for the first time someone supports me and i start to deal a little drugs but i also begin to use. Drugs such as weed, crack cocaine, and other things like that. One night the police bust me dealing and i end up serving a 6 month sentence in juvenile hall. I know no one and I am a loner there and i show no emotions. When i get out my parents take me home and beat the shit out of me for getting arrested. At this time i was too young to understand dyphus. As the years go on I believe my parents more and more about my life being worthless and me being a useless piece of shit. To relieve myself of all the negative thoughts i begin to abuse drugs more and more and stop dealing to start using only. After a few times of getting busted and going back to juvenile hall I begin to feel like i am going no where. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to present day. I finally get a boyfriend and he&amp;#39;s perfect. Issue is he lives 500 miles away so not much he can do to help me.

,depression_help,"For the past half year I’ve been working two jobs. One works with plants and is paid where I go 4 days a week for 35 hours, the other is an unpaid apprenticeship that I also work 4 days a week for 28 hours with a half hour commute to work (20 miles) and another half hour back. I work 7 days a week, with no days off starting about 2 months ago, when the apprenticeship asked me to be there more as is was not progressing fast enough.   


We just got a new manager at my paid job, (I do have an associate degree for this job,  but the apprenticeship is for art and is a dream I cannot pass on.)  He refuses to help water any plants, hides behind the desk the entire day, and shys away from helping at any point. I’ve tried to point this out to management but there is no communication and they just want a warm body to fill the spot.  
On top of that, I recently found out I had been clocking out for my 15minute breaks for the past year and a half there, not getting paid for them, and no one not even my manager told me I didn’t have to do that. 

All the extra responsibility has come down on me, and I no longer enjoy working there..   However I need money so just quitting for me was not an option. So I completely self sabotaged everything yesterday. 


I had to water the entire greenhouse which is the new normal now since he won’t help, and it’s so trivial but there was a plant that was very unusual that I had saved at the front desk, and it was gone. This put me into an extremely bad mood and I thought it would be a great idea to go get a couple shooters of liquor. And then I went back, twice, and ended up consuming 6 of them plus an energy drink. 

I don’t remember the end of the day. I apparently had a full meltdown crying how the manager doesn’t help and no one listens to me,on top of also complaining about how certain customers are perverts(they are), etc.   
A coworker took me home, and I couldn’t remember anything to tell my boyfriend so he had to call a coworker to find out. 


I did not go to work today. I expect to be fired so I’m just going to quit. They probably want me to come back just to train someone else. I’m disappointed I couldn’t keep it together long enough to even use my vacation time.  

I think I self sabotaged because I just couldn’t quit even though 7 days a week has been killing me.

,depression_help,"I've been experiencing something on and off for 4 or 5 years now (im 18). I don't know if I'm depressed.  I check a lot of the boxes. I feel worthless and hopeless, I struggle to remember and focus. Sometimes I can barely eat and even looking at food makes me sick. Other times I gorge myself. Sometimes I can't sleep and others I sleep for 10-12 hours, up to 14 sometimes. I feel like a failure. I'm anxious. I have this persistent fear that I'm unlovable and that my friends don't really like me, but tolerate me out of pity. Suicides thoughts are pretty common, especially recently. I often feel like life is not worth living and it never will be.

But at the same time, my life isn't falling apart. I'm not so hopeless that I can't bare to shower. I do decently in University. I have freinds. I laugh and have fun with them. I usually feel genuinely happy when we hang out together, but that ends once it's over. I'm pretty well of financially and I have a loving family. I feel guilty for feeling like this because my life is so easy.

Sometimes I have a few days where I feel happy and confident. Sometimes for a week or two. But it consistently comes back to feeling like crap.

So what do I do? I never feel like I can't do things. I stress alot, but I manage. But nothing ever feels worth it. I don't want to die but I don't really want to live either. The thought of dying feels practically neutral to me.

 It feels like my life is empty and I just try to fill the void by distracting myself with the dopamine rush of my friends, video games, alcohol and whatever else.

,depression_help,"I truly don’t know anymore. I don’t even know if this question is for this sub...

Anyways, here I am ranting to a group of complete strangers. I feel like utter shit. I don’t know who I am anymore. I mean, I’m looking at my room and it’s all scattered with clothes and random shit all over the floor.

I’m eating like utter shit. I’m eating all this processed food which I would’ve NEVER even considered eating before ( I used to be one of those annoying “whole foods” followers and even had anorexia at one point)... and at the same time I feel like I might be faking depression (but that’s for another post)...

Point is that I don’t know who the fuck I am  anymore. I feel like I died and was replaced by a fucking pig. I live like an actual pig. I mean, I can’t even recognise myself. I am ashamed when I think of my old self. I used to get such good grades and was extremely organised and thin... now I don’t know who or what I am.

I am rude (to the point where I make others around me uncomfortable, and they even avoid me). I can’t multitask at all... I mean either I socialise (by force because I’ve flaked on too many plans and eventually feel guilty and have to compromise every now and then) or I shower or clean my room. I can’t do them together (like a normal fucking person), instead it’s either I shower OR socialise OR clean my room.

I am so disgusted with myself. I go to sleep wishing to die only to have to wake up hearing my dreadful alarm clock indicating that I MUST start a new day. I am disgusted by other people’s happiness... am I jealous? Who knows? I just feel like they MUST be faking it. I’ve wanted to kill myself (but can’t and won’t because of my family). 

When did living become a chore? I sometimes feel like I’m just lazy and using excuses, but I was NEVER like this. I don’t know if I’ve always been like this subconsciously, because I can barely recognise myself. 

I used to be the type of person who showered twice a day and organised all of my laundry and clothes as soon as they were fresh off the dryer. I used to be a perfectionist and an “overachiever”. Now, I can’t even take notes. My handwriting looks weird... I go on these weird psychotic breakdowns where my handwriting looks like a maniac’s. 

I used to get occasionally sad, but over Christmas break all of my shit just flooded me. It’s bad... like REALLY bad (I never thought I might have ACTUAL DEPRESSION, since I would just cry every now and then, but I don’t know anymore)... 

I looked at my agenda today (it was my first day of high school after winter break) and I had scribbled all of these weird things. I remember doing them, but even my handwriting looked psychotic. The letters were all written in uppercase and they were scribbly and scary. I wrote shit like “English homework research (as if I can do that shit when I can barley even shower, hahaha)” and drew a weird face next to it... it was fucking weird. Then I scribbled all of these things like “cardio toxicity” and “how tall does a building have to be in order to die?” And “IV squeezing bag death”. I’m guessing I wrote all these things down in my agenda since my school doesn’t allow phones to be used (we have to hand them in the morning) so I wrote down the things that I’d google on a daily basis.

It happens when I feel suicidal, my handwriting gets all jumpy and I can barely focus on ANYTHING. I looked at my past entries,and they were all written neatly and beautifully.

I don’t know who I am anymore, I think I might be insane even! The only reason I’m not killing myself is because I started looking for psychiatric/psychological help and I am in the process of booking my appointment. I just want antidepressants (as if they might pull me out of this painful misery).

This was such a long rant (I’m truly sorry), but I think I need to hear some thoughts/experiences. I’ve never felt like this before in my life. 

I don’t know what the fuck I even have, but it is truly disgusting to see myself like this, but I don’t even seem to care as much even.

,depression_help,"Hey, i'm Bradley. I'm turning 16 close to the end of this year. This year's exams that are upcoming are really, really important and will determine my near future. It's stressful, but I always avoid getting stressed. Here's where the first problem comes in: when i'm not stressed, I don't worry about the exams. So in the end, there's completely no effort when the day comes.

Medication started about a month or two ago. So far, i've missed some days and yes, my psychiatrist knows. I won't elaborate on my problems but basically I have been diagnosed with depression after close to 3 years of suffering in silence. And it has been tough. Seeking help didn't relieve me that much, but it did. My mood changed a little, i'm kind of more positive in terms of my everyday life. Just school, sports and home. A cycle.

Everytime there's signs (which are triggers, but i'm afraid of telling my teachers or psychiatrist because i'm just too scared to) i'm always getting into that depressive episode. I get easily angry, especially to my friends and I tend to be impulsive during these ""anger moments"". 

It's tough dealing with depression. Really tough. Medication just makes it seem like I can't handle things on my own, and drugs are needed just for my mood to get better (I mean, when I was a child it was so easy to be happy, why not now?). I seem to never forget that without medication i'd be dead. I don't know if I should see it that way or whether I should take things on my own. It's masculinity, right? If we could handle this, we're stronger than others, right?

Even then, I only have the motivation to get up and get ""ready"" - if you can even call it that - is about 30 minutes before whatever time I leave.

This affects my self-esteem, I don't consider myself ugly, but I berate myself for not finding it in me to get up and be as maintained or good looking as the rest of my peers. I don't know how to cook like my friends, and I only really eat one meal a day \[ramen\] with some snacks such as chips and other unhealthy shit in between. This also makes me feel like shit...

I fell off important hobbies of mine and am never consistent. I used to have an art account on Instagram and draw every day, I used to try to write fanfiction, I used to make Instagram video edits whenever I could, but I fell off the editing train as soon as it started and while I want to be a concept artist in the future, I can't find it in me to pick up a fucking pencil unless I find it necessary. Now I'm even wondering if a competitive field such as art is even for me if I can't even find it in me to take care of myself. This is all the shit that is the source of my self-hatred sometimes. All I ever do is lay in bed, watch youtube,  read some fanfiction, and sleep.

The only source of true enjoyment I have is through my peers. When I'm with the homies it's like ""shit, finally, something to get out of bed for,"" and I think that's fucking sad because I'm not even getting out for me...

I know at the end of the day I should just get my ass up and just do something, but it feels like such a hike. I can accurately pinpoint what's bothering me, which is a good thing, but I beat myself up for not being able to do anything about it...

I also feel very alone, and I don't mean the sense of friendships. I'm talking about romantic relationships. I've had about 4 or 5 concussions, and I say that because I know I've definitely had some that weren't diagnosed as I used to box. It's just really hard for me to say what I want to say. I fumble my words a lot, and I noticed that after my most recent concussion about a month ago.

For example, one thing I said that I regret was calling a girl a ""dyke"" because she said something rude to me. What I said was so uncalled for, especially since I knew she was bisexual. I feel like trash because I don't say things like this (homophobic) all the time per-say, but that is just an example of how offensive and unregulated the stuff that comes out of my mouth on the daily.

I constantly have to be high on marijuana most of the time to keep my mood up and I don't want to be like that. The weed just makes things worse for me when I'm not high because I get even more irritable then I was before I smoked and I go through bad anxiety and psychosis episodes.

I also feel like a failure. I am in my senior year of high school and I feel hopeless. My grades are all F's and I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on going to trade school after this year but I probably won't follow through on that because I never follow through on anything I want to do,  as my anxiety prevents me from doing lots of stuff.

I think about suicide but the thought scares me and it's just and endless cycle of just that and it sends me down a dark hole in my thoughts. I feel hopeless like nothing can help me anymore.

Also, I don't want to sound pathetic but I told the girl I like that I liked her. She said doesn't reciprocate those feelings but it hurt when she said she liked me 2 years prior. It especially hurt because I liked her back then as well. Once again my anxiety prevents me from being happy and thats all I want, is too be happy again.

,depression_help,"(20)(F) before I begin I would like to say that I have Bipolar Disorder, Manic Depression, Anxiety and ADHD, and have been unmedicated for them for about 4 years.

This November will mark 4 years since I have last s*** h*****, but for the last 2 years the urges have sat in my mind. I've been feeling hopeless, worthless and like everyone would be better off without me. This August will mark 3 years that I have been with my boyfriend, and while he tries his best we still hit some rather bumpy spots that will send me into a low point ranging from days to weeks. I know he is trying his best, and I know that he doesn't mean to upset me, but I am just at a loss for what to do. 

About 2 and a half years ago we started renting our own townhouse. Things were great at first, but then we started getting stressed out because of our 4 roommates (2 sets of couples) problems. If they would argue it would rub off on us, and we had never argued before then. Shortly after my birthday last year, all of the couples left and we we're almost normal. We are stuck in a lease, with a rent we can't afford, because the new property managers decided to try and evict us for ""not paying the security deposit"". We only found out that it was still on our records once we had found an apartment, same size but only one bedroom, for half of the price we currently pay. We were hurt, and had no choice but to renew the lease. 

About a month ago, I became the only one working, and while I appreciate him trying to help around the house and doing what he can to make some money, it's just been stressing me out a lot. We have one of our friends moving in, but he is currently looking for a job which I know is only a minor setback, but is still stressful in my mind. I was once able to handle my emotions and my outbursts, but now I'm struggling to and just keep shutting down. 

The reason why I stopped taking medication was because I was tired if feeling like a starving, numb robot. I've tried multiple combinations and all of them have just taken away my appetite, all of my emotions, caused me to lose 25-35 pounds, and have made me sick. Since stopping I have maintained a healthy weight. I've lost all trust to therapists and psychiatrists after I had 2 of them go back to my mother with everything that was spoken about while in our private sessions. I just don't know if going back on medication would be worth it.

,depression_help,"So I (18M) have dealt with depression for years now. Recently I've been going to this doctor, same one my mom goes to. (My mom also has some mental health problems) so to start this doctor doesn't like jumping right to saying depression is the cause. But I've been on antidepressants and antianxiety meds for a couple years now.

So I get bloodwork done. I can't stand needles, but I get through it. She guaranteed that it would be hyper thiyroids. spoiler, it wasn't. So Mom and I go back a few days later to get the results. She confirmed it wasn't HT, but then started to explain what they found in the bloodwork. End of visit she gives list of meds and now I take a handful of meds twice a day and I hate it. I was fine with just taking a couple of small pills daily, but this is different.

I also am supposed to eat with the meds, but I eat only when I need food. Like gas for your car. So I get side effects if I don't take them with food (sometimes food doesn't help though) I get nausea, and start burping. And I hate both. I want to say something but I don't know how.

Now we get to the fun part. So I don't have a job, haven't sense right before Thanksgiving. (I worked at a Domino's in the DFW  area as a manager) So I got sick the week before Thanksgiving, went in to open but was trying to call out sick, get a few responses but overall the topic get ignored, all because the one person in charge of my store was sleeping in late on his day off. They contacted me for whatever they needed though. So I get upset. I called HR and I had one of the two people ignoring me there in about 20 minutes. I leave go get a Dr note and bring it in. 

Couple days later I'm all better. Go back into work and first thing I hear is one of the two beautiful men who we're ignoring me a few days prior call to the other man who'd been ignoring me aswell, asking if he's ready. Then they both greet me pull me into the office and I'm fired. Obviously not for calling HR. But whatever, i hated the job and all of the people I had above me anyway.

Holiday's pass and now we're here. So I smoke recreationally because it helps. I've heard shrooms are fun so I got some for Christmas, tried them (first time) it was great! For a like a week or two I was clear minded and almost everything was good. I could eat and sleep and function just fine. But I faded away from that and now I'm back to regular and it's hard to deal with. My sleeping and eating is still perfectly fine still, but I'm back in the same hell again. 

I want a job but I can't find the intrest or will power to do anything about it. Same thing with friends and a relationship. After the holidays the loneliness has been sinking in more and more. And now smoking isn't doing much. Unless I'm smoking with people. But I only have a handful of friends, but people aren't always available because they also have a life to live. 

But because I'm jobless I'm also running low on money because of the holiday's. So I'm slowly losing access to the things I've found help.

Edit: sometimes I'm so lonely I start fantasizing about killing myself by ODing on my meds, just to be free and explore, and find out more.

,depression_help,"24F. So one of my biggest struggles with depression is the cognitive impairments I face. I have issues with absorbing information, memory, holding conversations, a feeling of being empty headed and major lack of interest in anything. I’ve always done well in school but still feel like I don’t really know anything or remember what I read. 

I know these are standard symptoms of depression but my psychologist recommended I get neuro-psych testing done, she said “I don’t believe this is something you must do rather I think it could shed some light on these long-standing issues.” 

Has anyone ever had anything like this done? My only worry is that if they do find a learning difference such as ADHD then the solution would be to prescribe me a stimulant like adderall, something I already take for hypersomnia (a sleep disorder)... which makes me feel even worse that I still have these cognitive impairments/ brain fog while taking something that tends to make people sharper.

I recognise that I&amp;#39;m having issues with my mental health but I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. The only information I have(about mental health) is online and I&amp;#39;m an teenager. I&amp;#39;ve talked to my parents about my state of mind the first time I experienced a panic attack. But I feel like I&amp;#39;m talking to a wall, because the entire time I was struggling to breathe in the living room they were just both on their phones. And when I tell them about how I think seeking professional help could help my situation, they just say that they think putting me on meds is a bad idea. I had trouble making friends so I really don&amp;#39;t know anyone well enough to tell all of this to. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know how to &amp;quot;seek help&amp;quot;.

,depression_help,"I’m not sure where to begin with getting help. I’m not sure if I have depression as I don’t recall ever receiving a diagnosis but I do feel lethargic quite often. I remember having this feeling since I was in my early teens and I’m 30 now. Sometimes I have a burst of energy but mostly I’m tired.

I did receive a diagnosis of ADD when I was in my late teens that has gone untreated because so many I knew questioned the diagnosis because I’m “smart”. I have low confidence in myself or my ability to judge these things so I don’t know what to believe anymore. The medications they gave me always just made me feel weird although I didn’t try that many and was afraid of them.

Later, in college, I was diagnosed with bipolar by a nurse practitioner after an episode where I couldn’t sleep and had high levels of anxiety. Everyone I knew also questioned that diagnosis especially since the person who diagnosed me wasn’t a doctor or psychiatrist. Again I became quite confused. 

Often I think I must just be exaggerating my symptoms to the people who have diagnosed me because the people who I believe to know me best seem to think I’m fine. Yet I always seem to feel awful in one way or another. I have never been able to achieve much. I’ve had big dreams and ambitions and work toward them even when they seem hard for bursts of time then soon I can’t get out of bed again and I feel like I’m always taking a few steps forward then a few steps back. 

I can’t tell if this is normal. Maybe things I’m having problems with are normal and I’m just too lazy or lack the will to make myself rise above them.

I want to go to a doctor about this one day and I actually had been going but I lost my insurance right before I was going to be getting mental help again. It was a huge blow. My taxes are all messed up now and it seems I have to fix them before I can qualify for insurance that I can afford again. It’s hard to build up the energy to deal with all of this. I’ve been trying to fix things but it’s so complicated and exhausting.

I’ve been trying to research if there’s a way for me to get help without much money but her in California it seems I need MediCal for everything. But that’s the exact thing I’m having such a hard time figuring out. 

Does anyone know where I can turn to for help? Also am I stupid to think I even need or deserve help? I’m afraid to even go to a doctor again because I fear so much being turned away and told that I am just being sensitive or complaining about something made up. I just want some kind of help and I’m not sure I deserve it.

But sometimes she makes me so upset and she caims she doesnt know how I could be so upset than gets upset herself and tells me to break up with her
But I dont want to do that.

Weve promised to be together no matter what 
To run away together
I truly believe if I get her out of that house where her moms a drug addict and her sisters as well

But these past few times when ever shes made me upset ive taked to my sister about it and my mom

So now my moms upset and is saying things like ""it hurts me to think ive raised a daughter that will run back to that"" and nmes off toxic people in the family she compares me to in a disappointed almost disgusted tone

,depression_help,"Just seeking some solidarity...struggled with depression and anxiety on and off for about 18 years now (I'm in my early 30's). I'm deep in a current cycle but right now it's stronger than I've felt in a long time and I just broke down trying to do some work. *Apologies for the novel, but while writing this I realized how much better it felt to type it all out.*

Maybe it's a generational thing, but I'm not at all very open about my depression, on social media or in person. So, to all my friends, even, I'm a go-getter, entrepreneur, over-achiever Type A Person who can give *them* sage life advice. I just tried one of those crisis text lines and it was no help whatsoever. The questions she asked me are the things we discuss in therapy every time. My acute (and sudden) suicidal ideation was subsumed in the face of my annoyance, so I guess that's some sort of good news?

I'm one of those ""after gifted"" kids who showed so much promise, only to find myself in my 30's without a discernible career. I'm a classical musician with a master's degree who can't so much as get hired beyond local productions that don't pay much. I've put thousands of dollars, multiple NYC audition trips, 19 years of study, and 2 degrees into this. I decided a few years ago, as I approached the Actual Age Limit for young artists in my field to even apply for apprenticeships (yes, it's a thing), to start a band and use my skills elsewhere. Essentially ruining any chance of going back. The band is failing because of my lack of leadership and yearlong tumble back into depression. So on both accounts, I'm washed up. I know I should be so lucky to have any performance opportunities, but I expected so much more of myself. I feel like everyone did.

I left a small town and lower income family to strike it out on my own all the way on the other side of the country, so by all accounts I should be proud. But my sister was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 cancer last year, which has complicated my feelings about home and about guilt. How she can come to terms with her own certain cause of death and keep going, unable to drive herself or sometimes walk and I am over here whining about my lot in life? How could I have been so distant with my family for so many years? I'm trying to make up for a lot. I feel like I'm falling short.

I freelance to make money and find myself completely overwhelmed with unfinished jobs that aren't even going to pay that much and today while on InDesign trying to make an ad, I just lost it. Thinking of the band falling apart, of all the work I have left to do, how tired I am, of my sister so so sick. 

On top of that, my beloved cat of nearly a decade died a few months ago. I just adopted a new baby and she's so so sick. I'm terrified of losing her right now even though we are doing everything we've been instructed and waiting on new from the vet. I've spent the last few days cleaning up vomit and diarrhea, encouraging her to eat, giving her medicine. All while my work has piled up.

It feels like one thing after another.

I have a loving husband who knows the demons I deal with. But he shoulders so much of my anxiety on a daily basis. It's too much to expect of one person. He shouldn't have to be everything for me, but he really is. I don't know if he knows just how important he is to me. He's the only reason I've stopped my mental train whenever I start going down that really dark road. I spent many years taking him for granted and after a near-death experience a few years ago I vowed to never do that again. I saw everything he does for me and the fact that he works long hours to take care of us regarding of how much work I have coming in. It makes my current pain all the more poignant.

,depression_help," I have a lot to share, so I'm going to ramble until I run out of steam. Bear with my obnoxious writing style, please.

First, I'm doing, on paper, everything right: I exercise daily, stick to a consistent sleep schedule (with increasingly-vicious insomnia, I average seven restless hours), eat two meals a day with snacks in the interim (this despite my appetite being shot to shit), drink the recommended 64+ fluid ounces of water a day, socialize regularly with people whose presence is preferable to their absence, avoid abusive substances like the plague, and commit to being open-minded and honest with myself. That makes me wonder, with a shudder, how much worse this would all be if I slipped up on even one of those. I feel like I'm always teetering on the lip of a volcano, and one misstep will give me a blast of toxic fumes.

I don't have any friends. I don't know how to connect with people, despite having passable social skills. I'm not stopped by my fear of initiating conversations. They just... don't blossom into bonds that spark joy. I think, once upon a time, I had a friend. But I betrayed him, completely and totally my fault. The guilt from that disintegrated me, and forced me to start building self-awareness to avoid repeats—which, so far, I have achieved. But I don't think I ever managed to forgive myself for that, even if he did. The one person whose presence sparked joy... 

Y'know, for most of my life, I was convinced I was an introvert. It seems to me like most people—myself above all—are so lifeless and heartless that I shouldn't be anywhere near them. I go around saying I like most people, but that's nonsense. I'm too cowardly to admit that I despise most people, because most people reject you when they know you dislike them. I'm so starved for acceptance that I seek it from people with whom I'm like oil and water, (com)pressed together to give a brief illusion of connection. This is exacerbated by my paranoid hostility. I take things the wrong way and feel murderous rage over completely trivial things, and I'm not yet able to curb my lashings-out consistently, despite the remorse they lead to. I'm extremely sensitive, and haven't learned how to harness this double-edged sword for positive things. I hate hurting people, and I'm trying to stop, but I don't know how to try harder.

I can't even begin to fathom how many illusions like this ""I"" am buried under for my own sanity, but the sheer weight of self-deception is itself cracking my sanity, and ripping apart the seams of not-me, and all I see between the cracks is the waning light of an abortion that knows nothing but rage and fear. Who am I fooling by wearing a pretty face amidst the contagious putrefaction of the walled, overgrown human soul? All I do is spread the corruption—I'm not strong enough to purify it, or, worse still, maybe I *am*, and actively choose not to. Even my claim of wanting to become a good person—this too may be nothing but a self-serving artifice. I feel like a fraud whenever someone tells me I'm kind. I try to help people when I can, when they seek it, but I don't feel good about it. If it weren't for my ability to feel intense guilt, I'd think I was a sociopath, as my mother does. How can I help others when I can't even help myself? How can I want to help others when I'm not sure I can want to help myself?

On paper, my life is better than that of 95+% of everyone who's ever lived. I'm homeless, but in America, in a city where my survival is all but assured if I avoid the tweakers and gangbangers. Really, shouldn't I be grateful? I'm alive. I'm young. I'm more or less able-bodied. I can eat whenever I need to. I have my whole future ahead of me—except, I don't, from my standpoint, because I've never been able to think about my future. The wiring for future-thinking literally just isn't there. Are people literal when they ask me where I see myself in five years? I don't see myself at all, and it's hard to imagine myself anywhere but rotting in a muddy ditch, surrounded by garbage and maggots, forgotten by all. That's what I deserve.

None of these issues are because I'm homeless, though. They've been prevalent for as long as I can remember. The latest in my line of useless therapists told me that that's called dysthymia. I've asked people who knew me when I was young, and I gather that I've been depressed for at least 12 years (I recently turned 21), and in all likelihood longer; at the least, I have severe anger issues documented as early as preschool (4). I'm not sure what I'm supposed to put in this post, but the diagnosis of a depressive condition is a slight victory over my mom's claim that my symptoms were an adolescent phase. I'm not seeing a therapist right now, because all the therapists I've seen have been in over their head with me (note: CBD and mindfulness are meant for relatively moderate conditions; they’re unlikely to dent deep-rooted depression). Or is that just an excuse for not working harder? I've also had no luck with meds. I've tried five antidepressants from two or three different classes, and given each enough time to show me if they work. They didn't.

I'm going to get a house in a few months. Probably. But I'm all too aware that this won't better me. If anything, the constant stress of my current situation may be the only thing keeping me from collapsing like a dead balloon. I don't care about myself enough to muster the spark or drive or whatever to hold myself together on my own. My inner demons would accompany me to paradise, and infect it. I have the magical ability to pollute everything and everyone I touch. These very walls I erected around my heart to protect myself are now suffocating me, as there is no circulation, and within there is only entangled overgrowth strangling everything. I have people who care about me, I know it. But I can't find it in my heart to believe it. I feel like I waste their compassion because it doesn't seep into my marrow. It doesn't sink in. I don't get it. There's such a disconnect between my ""rational"" beliefs and the far deeper, far stronger bedrock beliefs, the Old Ones whose tentacles wrap around my fate and obscure everything in darkness and confusion.

I don't know anything about myself. I tried my hand at typologies, but my self-image is so incoherent and inconsistent that my results are all over the place. I’m completely enslaved to my own bias. I'm distancing myself from these labels that have seeped into and corrupted my identity, because I’m obviously not getting mileage out of them, but they showed me how utterly clueless I am about myself. Or maybe I just have too much of a special snowflake complex about being misunderstood and alien. I feel like a stranger from a strange land, imitating the Romans’ rituals to blend in, never belonging (this is common among fellow autistic folks, but I feel no kinship even with them). What can I say definitively about myself? Not much positive (and even this need for self-certainty reeks of insecurity). Even though so many people say positive things about me, and I can believe they’re being sincere, I just feel like I’m fooling everyone. What a brilliant actress I must be!

AND THIS HAPPENS EVERY WINTER. How can I delude myself about making progress when every year I slide right back to where I was? Progress worth calling progress should be more stable, right?! Yes, yes, progress is nonlinear, I get that, but it should tend upwards! One of my favorite symbols is the labyrinth as a representation of the self. When you travel through your labyrinth, you can be close to the core distance-wise but very far path-wise, or far from it distance-wise but surprisingly close path-wise. But I can’t heed my own reassurances and trust the process. I feel like I’m going nowhere. It’s not even directionless; it’s more like I’m scrambling up the slippery walls of an antlion nest, but whenever I seem to have a foothold, suddenly I’m in some Escher painting where up is down. Directionless after all... or a place where direction loses its meaning.

I also have such a poor sense of my own history that tracking progress apart from broad strokes is fiendishly hard. I have next to no autobiographical memory, and the few memories I have are vague, scattered impressions. Nothing coherent, nothing vivid. I tried journaling as a prosthesis, but I lost interest after having nothing interesting to write most of the time. This is true, to a lesser extent, with my memory for ideas or facts or whatever. It’s extremely frustrating. Depression is linked to weak long-term memory. I also live with constant brain fog. I don’t remember the last time I had a clear train of thought. I dropped out of high school because I couldn't handle even that much work. Things that come easily to people around me make no sense to me. I feel like an actual retard. Obviously, this flowery style is an overcompensation for that insecurity, but it’s just how I write and talk. (This apology is to avoid rejection from strangers whose opinions should have no bearing on me.)

Everything is just a shitfest. All of the advice about shifting perspectives seems shallow and naive to me. And, since it’s winter, it’s only going to get worse. I think about killing myself every day. I’m not going to try it, though, not yet. I don’t enjoy life. Even when I feel enjoyment, I can still detect despair in my periphery. It never lets me go. I know so many of my beliefs are self-destructive, but it’s like watching a train wreck in slow motion, and my body won’t respond. I don’t know. I don’t know anything. I’m exhausted, all the time. I can’t read for more than an hour without my brain melting, and after a few minutes, I’m already running on fumes, pushing myself to keep focusing through hollow determination. My body feels heavy, even though I’m in better shape than ever. I’m nauseous perhaps 20-30% of the time, and doctors can’t figure out what to do about it.

I don’t know. I can’t give up, but I don’t see a way forward. A house and a job won't make any of this go away; it was well into the ""severe"" range when I had both. Whenever I dared to hope in the past, that hope was shattered. I just don't have any reason to be hopeful. I don't care anymore. I'm a rotting corpse whose lingering traces of life compel it to move. An automaton without autonomy. A lifeless puppet. A blackened soul. Whatever. Depression is insidious because it turns your own will—the very weapon with which you would fight it—against you. I don't know how people deep in depression could ever be strong enough to muster enough will to climb out of their antlion traps when their reserves are depleted. I just don't get it. Help me, please. I don't know what to do. I'm nearing my wit's end.",t2_3ruws4it,False,,0,False,"I'm overwhelmed, lonely, hopeless, lost, and confused.

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#39;m doing, on paper, everything right: I exercise daily, stick to a consistent sleep schedule (with increasingly-vicious insomnia, I average seven restless hours), eat two meals a day with snacks in the interim (this despite my appetite being shot to shit), drink the recommended 64+ fluid ounces of water a day, socialize regularly with people whose presence is preferable to their absence, avoid abusive substances like the plague, and commit to being open-minded and honest with myself. That makes me wonder, with a shudder, how much worse this would all be if I slipped up on even one of those. I feel like I&amp;#39;m always teetering on the lip of a volcano, and one misstep will give me a blast of toxic fumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any friends. I don&amp;#39;t know how to connect with people, despite having passable social skills. I&amp;#39;m not stopped by my fear of initiating conversations. They just... don&amp;#39;t blossom into bonds that spark joy. I think, once upon a time, I had a friend. But I betrayed him, completely and totally my fault.

Asthma and eczema since I was a kid. My eczema would be so bad that everyday i had to rip the clothes of my skin because they would stick to me. My skin is thinner and wrinklier then i should be on my body. It also made me really irritable and nasty as a child, I don't think my parents knew how to cope with me when I was like that so I feel guilt towards the way I treated them.

When I was 16 I was diagnosed the Ulcerative colitis (UC) I was in and out of hospital, alot lost weight and time. Had to retake my Alevels. Resulting in me getting into a crappy uni. I pushed though and managed to get into vet school, but struggled with UC in my final year so much it has dented my confidence.

I was offered a job working as a vet in Singapore which I thought was a dream come true, but am now potentially looking at losing my sight due to glaucoma. I'm contemplating not taking the job, but then I'd have to tell my family about the potential glaucoma and all the work they put into my future will be for nothing and I will literally become a disappointment.

,depression_help,"I’m a 26 year old man who just finished my Master’s in Education last month.  I work 45 hours a week at a group home for disabled individuals who can’t look after themselves, making fourteen dollars an hour, plus overtime.  I’ve paid off all but my sophomore year of my undergrad schooling and half of my graduate loans.  I have a stable home life, my parents love me, don’t charge me rent and my mother has made it clear I can stay as long as I want (she genuinely likes having me around the house and I enjoy her company as well) and I regularly help around the house, doing dishes, walking the dogs, etc.

I don’t know what the hell I’m doing and I feel like a failure when a get into a slump.  I went to school to become a teacher but I was told I wasn’t up to snuff and will graduate without a license to teach and I don’t know what to do with my degree now.  I took my current job because I want to help people and it was the only one that took me.  But my boss, who I really liked,  left without warning due to stress (and this IS a stressful field) and now we’re scrambling to pick up the pieces and I feel alone at work.  I could talk to him, as in sit back and shoot the shit, not just have polite conversations.   Damn near everyone here is at least ten years older than me, often older.

I’m looking for a better paying job but I’m having no luck, though I would like to work for the state (pension) but damn near everything wants two or three years of experience.  And while my parents don’t charge me for staying and they actively shoot down attempts for me to put money in the house (I really wanted to put solar panels on the house) and I only pay for my car bills and gas (not insurance, they cover that) my student loans and my own health insurance (my job doesn’t pay great but the insurance is really good) I feel horrible for living off their generosity.  The logic part of my brain says this is actually fairly normal for my generation but the emotional side just isn’t listening.

And I get so worked up so easily.  I took a paid holiday for Christmas Eve and I’m not sure I’ll get paid for it until pay period after this one due to paperwork errors, a lack of a manager to talk to, and inability to reach payroll.  I just hate money being late so much, it stresses me out in ways I can’t describe.  And I feel like a failure because I have a sister.  She was the trouble maker, the liar, the one we had to call the cops on more than once, who didn’t finish college and barely got her GED.  She’s moved out of the house, has a loving relationship, and makes eleven dollars more an hour than I do.  That makes me feel like a failure.  And I just hate spending money.  I save 70% of my paycheck, pouring it all into paying off my loans (or emergencies, like when my car needed a new timing belt) even when I buy something I really like I feel like I’m not saving enough, even though I’ve made great strides in clearing my loans and I always save at least half of my check.

My family often tells me that I’m too hard on my self, I have only a few friends but they’re great ones.  I write in my free time and I love doing it, hundreds of people tell me I’m a good writer.  But I just feel like I should have done more by this point in my life.  I feel horrible because damn near everyone at my work has a second job except me.  I just don’t want to do that because I feel the stress would destroy me and I would cease to have a social life.  And that makes me feel lazy.

I really don’t know what to say.  I don’t know what to do next, I don’t feel I earn enough, and my job feels lonely.  I recently found an excellent D&amp;D group that gives me something to look forward to, I have amazing friends and s loving family, but I just feel like I’ve stalled out.

But my boss, who I really liked,  left without warning due to stress (and this IS a stressful field) and now we’re scrambling to pick up the pieces and I feel alone at work.  I could talk to him, as in sit back and shoot the shit, not just have polite conversations.   Damn near everyone here is at least ten years older than me, often older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m looking for a better paying job but I’m having no luck, though I would like to work for the state (pension) but damn near everything wants two or three years of experience.  And while my parents don’t charge me for staying and they actively shoot down attempts for me to put money in the house (I really wanted to put solar panels on the house) and I only pay for my car bills and gas (not insurance, they cover that) my student loans and my own health insurance (my job doesn’t pay great but the insurance is really good) I feel horrible for living off their generosity.  The logic part of my brain says this is actually fairly normal for my generation but the emotional side just isn’t listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I get so worked up so easily.  I took a paid holiday for Christmas Eve and I’m not sure I’ll get paid for it until pay period after this one due to paperwork errors, a lack of a manager to talk to, and inability to reach payroll.  I just hate money being late so much, it stresses me out in ways I can’t describe.  And I feel like a failure because I have a sister.  She was the trouble maker, the liar, the one we had to call the cops on more than once, who didn’t finish college and barely got her GED.  She’s moved out of the house, has a loving relationship, and makes eleven dollars more an hour than I do.  That makes me feel like a failure.  And I just hate spending money.  I save 70% of my paycheck, pouring it all into paying off my loans (or emergencies, like when my car needed a new timing belt) even when I buy something I really like I feel like I’m not saving enough, even though I’ve made great strides in clearing my loans and I always save at least half of my check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family often tells me that I’m too hard on my self, I have only a few friends but they’re great ones.  I write in my free time and I love doing it, hundreds of people tell me I’m a good writer.  But I just feel like I should have done more by this point in my life.  I feel horrible because damn near everyone at my work has a second job except me.  I just don’t want to do that because I feel the stress would destroy me and I would cease to have a social life.  And that makes me feel lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don’t know what to say.  I don’t know what to do next, I don’t feel I earn enough, and my job feels lonely.  I recently found an excellent D&amp;amp;D group that gives me something to look forward to, I have amazing friends and s loving family, but I just feel like I’ve stalled out.  That others do more.&lt;/p&gt;

I think about myself as an old child, unable to launch. Even though I started my own company, and began developing wordpress based websites, I haven't earned much my whole life. I feel like a total s\*\*t. For about a month I've met a girl in a nearby city, who is 5 years older than me. She has a stable job with a much better income than mine, but she pays for rent and says that she can't save any money. Both of us are the only children our parents have. She wants a child soon, so she is looking for commitment, but on the other way, she says that she is not willing to limit any of my freedom. I was through a couple of bad relationships and I am not into hooking up randomly and not even dating anymore.

I am very very frustrated and I don't know what should I do. Should I leave my parents, even if they need my help from time to time, take the nothing that I have and move with her? I am not confident, my schedule is a mess, I have a big problem waking up in the morning and I have no idea what to do.

,depression_help,"I’m talking literally any type of treatment for my depression. Some examples:

-Tried Celexa, the following week the depression had lessened (cuz i had so much faith in this pill cuz it helped my friend) then when it was when it was supposed to start “working” (they say all antidepressants take at least a month to work) which was around the time my ‘back to normal depressed me’ depression came back.

-Tried Ashawagandha &amp; Holy basil (adaptogens) &amp; felt relief of anxiety for a few days, then back to same old GAD self (cuz i have faith in natural remedies)

-Tried yoga &amp; exercise, but hard to keep up with when i’m too depressed &amp; anxious (&amp; it’s freezing out) to leave the house . i’d workout more in my house if the ceilings weren’t so low &amp; i had more privacy (i hate being watched, yes even if someone’s in the other room doing their own thing &amp; not even looking at me) 

-Tried eating more healthy (not saying i eat unhealthy), felt good for like a meal then nothing, but i’m such a picky eater it’s hard to always eat ‘the right stuff’ 

-Tried Positive affirmations, about 1/15 times it can give a little relief, but nothing that a deep breath couldn’t do

-Tried deep breathing, helpful to slow down breathing when anxious but extremely hard to remember to do

-Tried (&amp; still trying) therapy, but i’ve had multiple therapists &amp; after a bit it just turns into a chore/exhausting to continuously bring up like “yep, today i get to bring up my depression again &amp; remind myself of all the bad stuff yet again”.

The society where I think to live is different than the actual one: I feel confident at my home and nowhere else. I see the world like in a zombie apocalypse where  outside of my ""safe place"" it\'s full of ugly zombies who want you dead (no one can understand but I\'m really afraid of people outside, who\'re unfriendly for me). Going to school is also devastating and it\'s like going to the hell everyday, avoiding bunches of people who can have fun together, either because of my shame, anxiety and emptiness and due to my inferiority complexes I have in presence of other people than I reputate better than me cause I feel like a black sheep in a group with thousands of other white ones.

Definitively none.i don\'t really know why I live, I only know that my life has turned into fear, shame, sadness, devaluation of oneself, feeling of emptiness, loneliness (the only thing that can make me feel ok), uselessness, desire to die, apathy, extreme awareness, anxiety, stress, tiredness, problems, stupidity, banality, mental closure and so on. Problems brought me to other problems along with a surgery gone wrong and a bad lifestyle which could all have all dragged me in a vicious circle where every bad thing that happens brings you to another bad one which in turn leads you to something worse and worse and so on (such as an almost full social withdrawal).

Because of this I am very much unhappy, I feel like being stuck, doing something I don't want and therefore not living the life I want to. 

In such a situation what should I do to remain happy, such situation makes me depressed and I see no further purpose ahead.

What should I do? This depression doesn't make my life easier, I can't be happy so I have to fake that, but then I cry alone.

I know it is my fault no one forced me to join the course but can't a person make a mistake. If I have realised that why can't I be a given a chance to rectify it. That thing hits me hard

,depression_help,I have no sort of income for about 4 months if I read correctly on my insurance companies contract. I have about 40 dollars to survive on until I get some sort of income. I have bills to pay and the smallest one is on 39 dollars aprox. I have no idea what to do and my parents can’t help me out that much. So I’m basically a wreck that feels horrible about being a burden to everyone and can’t get a job because my doctor set me up for a new program that I’m in line for. I won’t get paid for it.

so I've been on medication for about 5/6 months now, sometimes I think it's helping and sometimes not. I'm very new to taking antidepressants so i don't want to disregard them just yet so am trying to hopeful about them.

I guess I'm just feeling very lost and down and my motivation just isn't there anymore. I have been reading lots about zen and meditation and I know exercise would help but I can't get the drive to do any of it.

,depression_help,"Basically the title, depression has been on and off thing in my life, and ever since I started meditating, I’ve felt much better as mindfulness is such a powerful tool. It’s pulled me out of or prevented many spirals.

But, as I was talking to a close friend of mine, she asked if it was healthy to meditate as a symptomatic cure for depression. I don’t know how to feel about it honestly.

On the one hand, being able to accept and let go all the feelings that come with depression as natural is invigorating and a godsend. But on the other hand, it’s made feeling pain, anger, and even sadness hard to experience.

It seems like meditation has granted me this unconscious ability of making walls out of compassion and empathy for others and myself, behind which negative emotions dissipate into nothing, and showing those emotions is nigh impossible, like my compassion just smothers it out.

,depression_help,"       Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it.
       So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I don't even exist. They don't believe me even if I tell the truth and don't ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. 
      The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed.
      I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I don't seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really can't see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents.

,depression_help,"Hey,
Yesterday I was at a party with my friends. I didn’t take my medication and thus I was really sensitive. Among those there was 2 friends of mine, I’ll refer to one as O and one as A. O and A are a couple, and O had been having a lot pain and familial issues so she was really stressed. While we were playing a board game, I tried to make a joke to a similar vain as one we had made earlier (treat the group as a classroom run by a pissed English teacher) so I yelled SHUSH. O snapped, saying “dude chill” and I was really taken aback. I’m super sensitive to people being upset with me due to past trauma, and with not having my meds, I shut down. When I do this, I get so quiet you can’t hear me even when I’m right next to you. I tried to say it was a joke, but O couldn’t hear me. Afterwards, I tried to hide it. I guess looked to O often to see if she was upset with me or not. During this period, O also texted me asking why I was looking at her, wondering if she did anything wrong, and I didn’t see it. I checked my phone too and didn’t see it, so she got the impression I was ignoring her. I felt so guilty. My trauma was rushing back, saying that O was gonna leave me and that I’m an awful person. I didn’t want to bring it up to her because I knew it was my fault. I was feeling so bad I felt like cutting myself. I go up to A and whispered to her that I wanted to cut myself. She told me not to, and to try to use a rubber band to reduce the harm. O was in the room at the same time. Again I didn’t want her to know because it was my fault.
I went into a bathroom and started snapping a rubber bracelet on my skin while I quietly sobbed. I decided to get the courage to go out where they were (as A and O had separated from the main group). When I got out there, A and O just stared at me, O looking upset. I said I wanted to get some food so they didn’t think I was imposing. I left, and snapped myself more. I finally saw the text O had sent me and texted her. I asked O if I could join them to talk and she said yes. I went out there and O talked to me about how she had felt hurt by me ignoring the text, the whispering, and such. I told her how I felt, my fears, and that I had been hurting my wrist. She got really worried, but was a bit cold too. She wanted me to communicate with her about these types of things. O is one of the best friends I’ve ever had and I didn’t want her to leave me (even though she wouldn’t, that’s past trauma for you). So I was apologising over and over again. I felt so guilty for ruining her night. I felt so guilty for upsetting her, for making her worried. I just feel like I’m in everyone’s way. And a part of me wants her to me apologise too? Even though it was my fault, and she did nothing wrong.
The thing is that this has happened on more then one occasion. I upset someone, they get understandably upset, and I get super apologetic and stressful to them. It makes me feel so disgusting about myself. Why would I put those I love so much through that?
I never know how to react. How can I make things better? I know I should talk to them, but what do I say? Probably my feelings, but I just want things to be ok.

,depression_help,"Hey, guys! This post might be long, so I don't know if everyone will have the time to read it. I've been depressed for a long time, somehow I am capable of getting past it and manage college, even tho before starting college I was so scared I thought I'll get in such a bad state that I will commit suicide, kinda weird considering that I am really scared of death in general. Somehow I can cope during the day, but during college at night sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I can't sleep, I shake my whole body, sometimes can't even keep my legs still, they get out of my control. There are many reasons that cause this dread. Like I miss my family, I get constant panic attacks, never had a relationship and feel pressured. I believe I miss love, like I need someone to talk with, to undersand me, to accept me as I am. I am considered the funny guy, it's funny cause the main reason why I am so sociable and funny is because this anxiety and panic push me to be this way, it's my way to cope with it. I tried to talk with some friends about this, but I mainly got responses like: ""Stop screwing around, you are the exactly opposite!"", which didn't help at all. I had some girls that asked me out and I refused, which is weird for me knowing that this is one of the things that might help me out of this. I refuse because I feel dull, and I feel like I'll just be a dissapointment for them, which is again exactly the contrary of what I am during a place in which I have to interact with people, be social. I said to myself that I'll not try to engage in strong relationships until I get to do what I love to do. I have an idea for a movie/tv show script and since I enjoy making people laugh, I want to do stand-up, both of which I can't start at all until I end college ,which will be in 4 years. I am a really driven by emotions, they are really intense, but showing them seems to me like a weakness, to people I intact with, I myself want to show them but I just can't, considering myself ridiculous when doing it(I had some bad experiences during high-school and I think that's why). Does anyone have any suggestions for what should I do?

I&amp;#39;ve been depressed for a long time, somehow I am capable of getting past it and manage college, even tho before starting college I was so scared I thought I&amp;#39;ll get in such a bad state that I will commit suicide, kinda weird considering that I am really scared of death in general. Somehow I can cope during the day, but during college at night sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by everything that I can&amp;#39;t sleep, I shake my whole body, sometimes can&amp;#39;t even keep my legs still, they get out of my control. There are many reasons that cause this dread. Like I miss my family, I get constant panic attacks, never had a relationship and feel pressured. I believe I miss love, like I need someone to talk with, to undersand me, to accept me as I am. I am considered the funny guy, it&amp;#39;s funny cause the main reason why I am so sociable and funny is because this anxiety and panic push me to be this way, it&amp;#39;s my way to cope with it. I tried to talk with some friends about this, but I mainly got responses like: &amp;quot;Stop screwing around, you are the exactly opposite!&amp;quot;, which didn&amp;#39;t help at all. I had some girls that asked me out and I refused, which is weird for me knowing that this is one of the things that might help me out of this. I refuse because I feel dull, and I feel like I&amp;#39;ll just be a dissapointment for them, which is again exactly the contrary of what I am during a place in which I have to interact with people, be social. I said to myself that I&amp;#39;ll not try to engage in strong relationships until I get to do what I love to do. I have an idea for a movie/tv show script and since I enjoy making people laugh, I want to do stand-up, both of which I can&amp;#39;t start at all until I end college ,which will be in 4 years. I am a really driven by emotions, they are really intense, but showing them seems to me like a weakness, to people I intact with, I myself want to show them but I just can&amp;#39;t, considering myself ridiculous when doing it(I had some bad experiences during high-school and I think that&amp;#39;s why). Does anyone have any suggestions for what should I do? Like I really struggle to find a way out of my dread, considering I may know the solution, but I have no balls to start doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"-i’m 22. &amp; have had anxiety &amp; depression for a decade now (since age 11/12)-&amp; yes i’ve been in therapy since then, few therapists cuz no one knows how to help me (not blaming them, blaming me for being impossible)
-dropped out of art school last november (14 months ago) because Zoloft made me suicidal &amp; school was a stressful waste of money to me. 
-i haven’t had a “real job” since May 2018 (-ive had my own reselling business online for 1.5yrs but no one counts that as accomplishment)
ever since being on Zoloft i have become even more (than i already was) of an introvert &amp; very socially anxious person.
-my best friend moved out of state mad far away. 
-my other hometown friends are in college partying having a blast with their social &amp; exciting friends.
-so in the past year i have hung out/socialized with people/friends maybe like 5 times. in 365 days. i know it’s insanely disgusting that i don’t socialize. but i have no reason to. i get nothing but more stress out of it.  

what happens if i DO socialize (once in a blue moon) is:
-usually too anxious to go thru with hanging out so i “ditch” last minute, aka panic episode 
-get so nervous that i won’t be the ‘same ol me’ because my depression is so so so obvious-i mean my tone of voice is terribly boring.
-not as exciting or fun as i had hoped
-not feeling like im the same person makes it hard to be ‘myself’ (my depression-negativite thinking- used to only be visible if speaking of self, but now it’s visible 24/7) 
-when i’m hanging with someone, what’s always flooding my mind is “when do i get to leave and be alone”

BUUUT the most messed up, confusing, &amp; frustrating part is that like i’m BEGGING for socialization. like my mind NEEDS it i can like sense it. i want to have conversations with people, i want to exchange ideas &amp; thoughts, but if i go ahead and do so, it like doesn’t follow me there. in the moment i’m socializing i want to leave immediately. in moments im alone in my room, i want to be out with friends having an exciting thrilling time. but it never happens anymore. not in over 2 years. it’s like i can’t be comfortable with myself or something i really don’t know. &amp; i really don’t know what to do anymore.

(because i’ve tried/currently trying &amp; don’t need duplicate answers that haven’t worked for me) NOT Welcomed::

-dropped out of art school last november (14 months ago) because Zoloft made me suicidal &amp;amp; school was a stressful waste of money to me. 
-i haven’t had a “real job” since May 2018 (-ive had my own reselling business online for 1.5yrs but no one counts that as accomplishment)
ever since being on Zoloft i have become even more (than i already was) of an introvert &amp;amp; very socially anxious person.
-my best friend moved out of state mad far away. 
-my other hometown friends are in college partying having a blast with their social &amp;amp; exciting friends.
-so in the past year i have hung out/socialized with people/friends maybe like 5 times. in 365 days. i know it’s insanely disgusting that i don’t socialize. but i have no reason to. i get nothing but more stress out of it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what happens if i DO socialize (once in a blue moon) is:
-usually too anxious to go thru with hanging out so i “ditch” last minute, aka panic episode 
-get so nervous that i won’t be the ‘same ol me’ because my depression is so so so obvious-i mean my tone of voice is terribly boring.
-not as exciting or fun as i had hoped
-not feeling like im the same person makes it hard to be ‘myself’ (my depression-negativite thinking- used to only be visible if speaking of self, but now it’s visible 24/7) 
-when i’m hanging with someone, what’s always flooding my mind is “when do i get to leave and be alone”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUUUT the most messed up, confusing, &amp;amp; frustrating part is that like i’m BEGGING for socialization. like my mind NEEDS it i can like sense it. i want to have conversations with people, i want to exchange ideas &amp;amp; thoughts, but if i go ahead and do so, it like doesn’t follow me there. in the moment i’m socializing i want to leave immediately. in moments im alone in my room, i want to be out with friends having an exciting thrilling time. but it never happens anymore. not in over 2 years. it’s like i can’t be comfortable with myself or something i really don’t know. &amp;amp; i really don’t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(because i’ve tried/currently trying &amp;amp; don’t need duplicate answers that haven’t worked for me) NOT Welcomed::

Hi, I'm Viktor. I'm 17, I live in the US, and I just feel kinda lost.

I have a best friend that's my age. She lives overseas though. So our only method of communication is online messaging or calls. 

Recently, I've been feeling really just kinda empty and bad. I've been on break (and it's almost over) and through it all, I've struggled to feel happy. I have to fake all my smiles so that my family don't start worrying about me.

Due to this feeling of emptiness, I would talk with my friend a lot about it. But I thought that I was being annoying, so I told her I wouldn't talk with her again until I feel better. It's been about 3 days. Which is a bit because we just about talk every day.

Today I've just been crying and haven't been able to stop until a little over 30 minutes ago. It sucks, and it hurts, and I don't know what I'm doing.

I missed the deadline to apply to the college I wanted (the final deadline), and I don't think they'll take my application late.

I’m 17 this year and went for a free mental health checkup a few days ago (parental consent and knowledge not needed) which confirmed that I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. I’ve been feeling the symptoms for a little over a year now and attempted suicide a few months ago. Now that I have confirmed that I have depression, I’m not sure what to do next. They recommended that I look into getting a psychiatrist and psychologist for medicine and counseling respectively, especially since my family has a history of depression. However, since I’m underage, I need parental consent.

I’m not close to either of my parents or any of my siblings and I have quite a lot of bad memories from my childhood as well.

I’m a 20 year old art student who lives in Belgium. Two years ago I started taking anti depresive medication. It helped me a lot. I was in a really bad place and with help from my parents, some big changes in my life and medication, things got waaaay better. 
The passed year I’ve been enjoying life like I never did before, I was truly happy. Right now I’m spiraling down again. I don’t want to bother my friends or family with it (I did that so many times the first time I was really down) so no one really knows about it. I try to do my best, I have a job, I study, I go out a lot.. but lately I felt really really lonely and sad. I have everything and everyone to be happy but the thing I do the most through the day is fighting my tears and hating myself for it. 
I don’t know what to do anymore.

My monster taught me that i am irrelevant. nothing i do will matter. There are like 8 billion people and one sole truly ask me how i am.&lt;br/&gt;
My monster has grown stronger than me now. its trying to push me off the ledge and i dont have the strength to fight it. My monster is scary now and i am sacred.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"hello everyone my name is Jake and this is my first reddit post. I'm 21 and have been struggling with depression for a majority of my life. my story starts out when i was 12, my parents got divorced. my mom moved out and my dad ended up having to sell the house I grew up in. through all that i was Just starting middle school and had been moved away from all my childhood friends and rezoned for school. desperate to be accepted and make friends i started to act out and became a part of the schools problem children. In 7th grade i began smoking weed and drinking. i had racked up 31 detentions and 2 ISS's. my parents were obviously furious with me and blamed the people i hung out with. the same kind of behavior continued through 8th grade, and then i got to high school. i had been caught with weed before and each time would be grounded for at least a month where i wasn't allowed to do anything. while being grounded i would start to become extremely depressed. everyone even your family treated you like you were a criminal. by the time i turned 15 i was arrested for the first time for simple possession of weed. while on house arrest i quickly began to realize that the people i was hanging out with wernt real friends as most of them stopped talking to me because we couldn't smoke together. this only made me hate life more, and so i began cutting myself. i had never done bad in school but i didn't really study and didn't really care all together. another year passes and i fall deeper into drugs, by the age of 16 I had tried about everything besides meth or crack and had became a heavy drinker. constantly getting into trouble i slowly push my family away. me and my friends began to brainstorm on how to make money and we decided robbing peoples drugs was a good way. we first attempted it on the weed man. we game him a bunch of fake bills rubber banded together with a real one on the outside. and sped off. he took it and could never find us. we tried it again on a different guy and he ended up jumping on top of my car as we sped away tapping a gun on the window so i stopped and through the weed out and he jumped off. i had just turned 17 and i got arrested again. this time was a bit more serious, and we got a news story about us. some people were at the basket ball court messing with us so we got in my car and shot all them with the bb gun i had in the trunk. they ended up calling the cops and i got 8 felonies for it. by now my family has almost lost complete faith in me and i hate myself too. i began to dig deeper into my depression as threats of being sent away began to be thrown around. i met a girl that i really liked and we started to become a thing. all was good until our friend group started doing pills. she ended up fucking my best friend and lied to me about it. this was the worst i had ever felt in my whole life, i genuinely loved her. i began to cut myself more and more and thoughts of suicide began to rise. all i could think is how i've lost all my friends,how my family hates me, and what a terrible example/ influence i had become on my 2 younger brothers. later that year i got arrested again for graffiti and got felony vandalism. it was only a month before i turned 18 so luckily all my charges were expunged because i did them all as a minor. feeling like all i've done is fuck up my whole childhood, i decided to apply for college and attempt to makes my parents proud. dropping all of my old friends, i tried to start a new life. the first 2 weeks of school i had gotten arrested for underage drinking. i really started to lose hope, but i decided to keep pushing myself. i have been working very hard the past few years and am now a 4th year engineering student. every now and then i would fail, but i would just keep pushing and trying harder. however the smarter and more mature i become the more i begin to realize how cruel and pointless life is. we spend the majority of everyday doing stuff we don't enjoy. surrounded by toxic social media and propaganda that just breeds depression and hate. i'm not religious so i see no real point in anything, no deeper meaning to life. i'm now finding myself in a place to where i hate waking up every morning, and my past mistakes have turned me into someone i hate. i've been majorly depressed lately and the only way i know how to deal with it is cutting my self. i keep telling myself to stop but i just get really drunk and end up doing it anyway. i now have giant scars all over my upper arms that i will try and hide from my family for the rest of my life. one night was particularly worse than the others, and i decided i was going to kill myself. i put my pistol to my head and sat in my room crying and drunk. i was in there for an hour or so and realized i couldn't do it. i didn't have enough resolve, not enough reason. everyday i wake up so depressed i cant even eat sometimes. i feel like i'm just waiting for something significant enough to happen to were i finally get pushed over the edge and i can finally end it all. school is so depressing and difficult but i know i need to finish it, i just wanna make my family proud. not really sure why i decided to make an account and post this, but id appreciate any advice.",t2_2lkyjud3,False,,0,False,my story.,"[{'e':

Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time.

,depression_help,"I'm going to proceed to explain my story so,
Tl;dr: I've lost my focus,my drive,my energy. Everyday I just want to sleep because dreams and nightmares are way more thrilling to experience than real life. I trust no one and feel like a completely shallow and empty person. I want to get out of it but everytime I try coincidentally incidents have happened proving me I'm not in the right environment.I just want to be erased as if I never existed.  I've never asked help from the internet because how will the internet understand from just text and stories. But now I have no choice.


My story: I come from a middle class family. Money is not a big issue but it is to be valued a lot. My parents are very strict and overprotective. Since birth,I can remember my parents telling me about their childhood and how poor they were and how hard they had to work to come out of it. Naturally,a lot of pressure was put on me to be perfect and become richer than them.But I had a huge problem. I got angry quickly and when I saw my friends do something that was not considered perfect by my parents I would get angry and lash out at them.My parents would scold me and slowly I started resenting them just as my friends would start resenting me. I was 8 years old at that time. When I found out that my friends secretly hate me I felt ashamed and regretful and the only solution that I could think was to  supress my anger. Soon I saw my parents stop loving each other and become completly cold to each other. The only reason they stay together is for me and my sister's sake. I cant help but feel absolutely guilty about this.On the other hand in the name of concern and love they have done acts that I now find unforgivable. Then as I grew up I stopped talking to my friends who I grew up with. Word on the street is that they find me odd and refuse to talk to me because they are afraid of me.In school I was a completely different person. I was reserved and only spoke when needed. I was popular in school as I had won various trophies for them but I never had friends just acquaintances. I thought I am a freak. I was never invited to birthday parties or any occasion and I cant be bothered to know why.All I know is for unknown reasons I was isolated by everybody I know and to distract myself I started playing video games and fell in love with it. But my father wasn't pleased with it and instead of offering a solution he would just berate me for my faults. I started feeling used by the world. I've even have had people telling me ""why I try too hard,its not as if I have friends or anything"".I know I shouldn't be affected by such cliche comment but honestly my whole life I've never had a coping mechanism. 
            After school I made sure to take a college far away from my home and school.Far away from all the negativity. A new me. Boy did college kick my ass.To join clubs and all we had to give interviews about ourselves. That's where everything broke. Questions like tell us about yourself and what do I value etc. And they wanted personal responses and I couldn't honestly answer. College became a place where I put up a persona for everybody and I didnt enjoy it. I still didn't have any friends because that works on popularity on Instagram and snapchat and facebook and I didn't have one because I never got a reason to get one. Not only that people formed groups of similar liking and I guess I am different. The only thing I did for fun is browsing youtube and watching from veritasium to ksi to james charles. I watched youtube to kill time. Soon I wanted to kill myself. Obviously now my parents enter the scene but to my shock they took it as me rebelling because im in that phase.....WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
       Anyhow,we did go see multiple psychologist but failed. In the end my education is more important than my health. Now I've applied to go abroad for my higher education but I've given up. I see no point to anything. All my actions are worthless. No one has time or patience to listen to me. While I was  in therapy I  got into drugs. Had to take a drop from college. I'm no more the perfect person I was and no one cares if I succeed or fail. I hate myself for what I was and what I've become. My whole life feels like a waste of opportunities. I don't understand.
 Why is hating easier than love. Why do we have to try everyday to love but disgust just comes to us naturally. Why is it hard to trust. How do you trust. I dont feel like doing anything. I just want to close my eyes and imagine the world is empty with nothing present. My own father called me a monster. What did I do? I dont know. Where was I doing wrong.Ive hit rock bottom.

•Feeling like I'm just a stand in for my own life (life just passing by, as if I'm a shadow of myself, as if how I used to be is now impossible to ever reach again).

•Feeling suicidal at times, having suicidal thoughts... and on a certain antidepressant I had two episodes of almost committing suicide...

•Absolutely no interest in sex anymore

•Feeling completely distant from partner/ruminating thoughts of ""do I really love them/are we going to work out/are we right for each other"" 

•constant overthinking, and lots of ruminating thoughts in general

•Loss of interest in all hobbies, and my passion in life is all but snuffed
out

•Trouble sleeping and staying asleep, always tired and have little energy

•Often easily irritated/prone to anger/hateful momentary thoughts

•A LOT of trouble focusing especially at work (I imagine it's what ADD feels like?..)

•A general destitute outlook on life..I have no light in my eyes anymore, I'm dull and listless.

I don't know what to do other than therapy which I've been doing... I'm on a waiting list for a psychiatrist...but that's not until fucking April and honestly I don't know if I'll make it that long... I'm getting very desperate, wanting to fix it all but I don't even know where to start.

,depression_help,"Hey everybody,

My life itself has always been pretty good, but my quality of life has been awful for the last 8-ish years. I am currently 23, and this is a quick timeline of what's been going on:

* Age 13-14, started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. Also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. Doctor thought it might be anxiety/depression so suggested I see a therapist and try some antidepressants. I tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. Antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. This generalized anxiety/worry/stress feeling continued.
* Age 16, while still dealing with the above, I woke up one day after a good night's sleep and felt a little tired. I attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it NEVER went away. But it was very mild, so I just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. Over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where I'm at now where I can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue/brain fog. It is 24/7. Not even a second of feeling better.
* Age 17-present: Have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. Food allergy, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, MRI, EEG, EKG, Lyme disease, Epstein Barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. Have tried a total of 7 different antidepressants/anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. All either did nothing or made me more tired/foggy. I’ve tried Vyvanse, Adderall, Ritalin, kratom, CBD, kava, and countless other supplements. The stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn’t help my mind, or didn’t do anything. Caffeine in any form doesn’t help either. I’ve seen 3 different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. 

I feel this intense dissociation feeling 24/7 that has gradually emerged/worsened over the past couple of years. Like I'm so tired, I don't even feel like I'm in real life ever anymore. I feel drunk/drugged, especially as the day progresses. Come 8 PM, I feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. Sometimes, I feel so tired I feel physically ill. The gradual cognitive decline is shocking (Concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing/recalling/stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc.). My motor skills have also declined badly as well. I bump into things, my reflexes are awful, I miss things when I try and grab them, etc. I feel dizzy/lightheaded when I stand up after sitting or laying down. I now have very low arousal. It's almost impossible to startle me. It's like my body doesn't even process loud noises or scare anymore. I feel anxious/stressed/overwhelmed more easily. Everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal I get to check off. Even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. Decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. Hypersomnia (Usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia). Vision has declined (eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity). Eyes are dry/watery off and on. Numbness all over body. Tough to explain, but extremities/body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb-like to the touch. Like I can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can’t feel my hand touching my arm. Senses feel dulled (Hearing, taste, smell, touch) all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and I feel more tired. Sex drive is virtually non-existent. Alcohol hits me much harder now. As a result, I feel intoxicated more easily/quickly. Sometimes 1 beer and I'm already feeling really drunk. I’m slow now both mentally and physically. Head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but I don't get headaches that often. I yawn way too much. Anhedonia and apathy as I’ve gotten tireder and tireder. I have gradually become indifferent to most things. I literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because I am so damn exhausted 24/7. Almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. I feel like I get every cold/flu virus that comes around. And it takes me much longer to get over them. I am emotionally flat lined. One of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and/or when I’m more tired. I feel like I need lots of sleep to “recover”, but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. All of these symptoms seem to be worse when I’m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc.

Overall, it feels like I was hit by a truck. From the moment I wake up to the moment I pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. Everything feels like it's suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. For example, caffeine’s effect, sex drive, post-workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. I can sort of FEEL all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. It’s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. It literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. And the thing that sucks is that I WANT to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but I'm just too out of it, it's embarrassing. I come across like a drugged zombie when I try.

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically, the last kind of test I can do at this point is a sleep study, which is in a few weeks. In a way, sadly, I hope they find something.

We had hiccups in our relationship along the way because of our mental illnesses, but we always ended feeling better knowing that we were there for each other and talking about our problems. However, recently, my boyfriend’s depression is getting way worse- to the point where he says that nothing helps him anymore, not even me. He has been seeing a therapist for about 3 months, but he says it just makes him feel worse. He won’t tell me how he feels anymore because he says that it just makes him feel worse talking about it. He says that he doesn’t care about anything anymore, and that he hates himself every second of the day. 
Last week, he hinted at suicide. He claims that he doesn’t have a plan or is not determined to go through with it, but he says that he really wants to die and was thinking and imagining the different ways he could take his own life. I encouraged him to call the national suicide hotline, and he did and said that it didn’t help. I have his mother’s number, but his parents are a part of the reason that he is depressed and he claims that reaching out to them will make the situation worse. We met in college, so we are both home right now about 5 hours apart so it’s not guaranteed that I can be there for him in person. We have FaceTimed almost every day during winter break and I have been nothing but loving and supportive, reminding him that I’m here for him and that I love him and care about him, but he is so distant and seems to be so irritated with everything I say, which is hard not to take personally but I understand this is normal.

,depression_help,"So I've been properly depressed two years ago in winter (was suicidal and felt empty for the most), didn't get diagnosed but the symptoms were too clear to be anything but a mental illness. It got better in summer and I understood what had happened and started getting a positive mindset and all that stuff to prevent myself from getting into another depression. For last year that worked quite well and it also helped that I fell in love with this cute boy. We became a couple on new years eve. Fast forward 9 months and I start feeling quite empty and depressed. I'm fighting it, but school made self-love and self-care incredibly difficult. So I was quite down but of course kept hope and knew I would be better in summer and my boyfriend supported me as good as he could. He is majorly depressed and suicidal and said I kept him from killing himself when we became friends. We kinda supported each other and that atleast gave us a reason to keep going. Not a good way, but better than the other option. It got horribly complicated between us and I tried my absolute best to safe the relationship which back then meant getting healthy and not being a burden. So I did. I worked my ass of having the most antidepressing lifestyle possible and the newfound motivation helped greatly. We couldn't really communicate in that time or as I later found out he simply ignored me. So one and half weeks ago he broke up with me over text. At that point I wasn't depressed or anything anymore I think. It crushed me but my positive mindset I had build up saved me from falling into a cycle of selfhatred and confusion. I've cried a lot at first but am quite alright now. I accept that he has to do what is best for him. I'm ok with that. So here's why I'm writing all this.
I feel pretty stable. I feel pretty good actually. Like I don't hate myself or think bad about myself. I have quite a lot of fun doing things.
On the other hand my body is showing quite dramatic symptoms. I've lost 4kg in the past two weeks (mostly fat, because of impulsive workouts to deal with the emotional stress) and my eating is a bit off. I also lay in bed doing nothing for hours at a time when I don't have a very specifications reason to get up. I lost a lot of discipline and a bit of interest in my hobbies. I'm always tired (well, more than usually) but I feel quite happy in general.

,depression_help,"So as the year draws to a close, I'm beginning to feel more lonely. My only real friend (besides my wife) is a military veteran with substance abuse problems and PTSD, and hasn't been talking to me hardly at all lately. It's been over a week since he texted me anything more than a two word reply, otherwise he's been ignoring me. I mean, I get that he's busy with work and his own family, but I feel like he wants nothing to do with me. 

I've had a dream about him telling me that there only way he can put up with me is with lots of, well, an illegal substance. Obviously he hasn't said that IRL, but the worry is there.

My only real friend (besides my wife) is a military veteran with substance abuse problems and PTSD, and hasn&amp;#39;t been talking to me hardly at all lately. It&amp;#39;s been over a week since he texted me anything more than a two word reply, otherwise he&amp;#39;s been ignoring me. I mean, I get that he&amp;#39;s busy with work and his own family, but I feel like he wants nothing to do with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a dream about him telling me that there only way he can put up with me is with lots of, well, an illegal substance. Obviously he hasn&amp;#39;t said that IRL, but the worry is there. If we physically hang out and visit, he seems okay, if a bit occupied on his phone, but he ignores my attempts to check in on him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I should just distance myself from him for a whole and let our wives set things up, or keep reaching out every so often to let him know I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten about him. I just really don&amp;#39;t know what to do any more.&lt;/p&gt;

I blame the holidays. Or the post-holiday. Or maybe not. I dunno.

My husband and I didn’t really do the Christmas thing. We exchanged stockings but agreed on no gifts. The family (my husbands) agreed to no gifts among the adults, just the kids, and instead we’d take a trip as a family. It was 4 days, 3 nights with the in laws. All things considered it went well.

But we got home yesterday and I was exhausted. And disappointed. Like, Christmas isn’t how it was when I was a kid and it never, ever will be again. No magic, no surprises, no excitement. Just stress and money. And my own family will never be together because my parents split way back when I was a teen.

I just feel... disappointed. In holidays, in adulthood, in life. 

Tonight is a friends NYE party and I just want to stay home. But they’re also my neighbor so I can really get out of it.

My husband doesn’t know what to do. I’ve been crying since yesterday morning. I had trouble getting out of bed. I’m fine one minute, laughing at a joke, the next a wave of sadness hits me and I start sobbing.

I’m anxious about the future too. Stupid things. Like, what if the world ends? Kind of things. What if I die young? What if I never get better?

I have one more week until I go back to work and I beat myself up every holiday break I get that I didn’t spend any time relaxing. And now here I am fretting and my husband says it’s ok, you have the whole week. But to me it’s like omg I only have a week!!

,depression_help,"I've experienced severe depression for the last decade. It's gotten worse over the years, and since my brother passed it has been especially bad. My family can't really seem to help or understand, and I don't have many friends these days. 
I moved to a new city from Florida last year to start a new life and things were good for a bit. Then it was the same old. 
But it got worse, as I started having panic attacks at work. Crying, sweating, it sucked and was very embarrassing. I live in a segregated city and I'm not always around people who feel like me, and that can hurt too.
I feel so lost and so gone already. I can't shut the voices out. I lost my job again. I used to dream of providing for my family and I can't even take care of myself.
I'm at the point where rent is due in two days and I don't know what to do. My roommate is a very kind person and she doesn't deserve that burden. I am planning on killing myself tomorrow, but she doesn't deserve that burden either.
I'm just so tired of hating who I am and I can't get help. I'm in therapy. I even tried going to the suicide chat lines tonight but the ones I checked out were full. I'm so so tired and it feels like I'm screaming into nothing.
So many people have done so much to try to help but it just keeps coming back around. I can't keep doing this. I spoke to my Dad but it came back to religion as usual.
I love him so much but I wish he was really listening to me. I put so much effort in the past few hours into convincing myself that it's my time to go but I'm posting here because I don't want to be alone. I always feel so fucking alone. I can't keep being here.
In college I spent so much time with people who made fun of my weight. I let them say whatever they wanted about me as a black man, and it really really fucked with me. I can't get their voices out of my head either.
I love improv and for awhile it kept me going. But I've missed so many shows and disappointed so many people, I feel like I can't even show my face in the scene anymore.
I keep thinking about how angry people will be with me for killing myself but I just can't anymore.

But it got worse, as I started having panic attacks at work. Crying, sweating, it sucked and was very embarrassing. I live in a segregated city and I&amp;#39;m not always around people who feel like me, and that can hurt too.
I feel so lost and so gone already. I can&amp;#39;t shut the voices out. I lost my job again. I used to dream of providing for my family and I can&amp;#39;t even take care of myself.
I&amp;#39;m at the point where rent is due in two days and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. My roommate is a very kind person and she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve that burden. I am planning on killing myself tomorrow, but she doesn&amp;#39;t deserve that burden either.
I&amp;#39;m just so tired of hating who I am and I can&amp;#39;t get help. I&amp;#39;m in therapy. I even tried going to the suicide chat lines tonight but the ones I checked out were full. I&amp;#39;m so so tired and it feels like I&amp;#39;m screaming into nothing.
So many people have done so much to try to help but it just keeps coming back around. I can&amp;#39;t keep doing this. I spoke to my Dad but it came back to religion as usual.
I love him so much but I wish he was really listening to me. I put so much effort in the past few hours into convincing myself that it&amp;#39;s my time to go but I&amp;#39;m posting here because I don&amp;#39;t want to be alone. I always feel so fucking alone. I can&amp;#39;t keep being here.
In college I spent so much time with people who made fun of my weight. I let them say whatever they wanted about me as a black man, and it really really fucked with me. I can&amp;#39;t get their voices out of my head either.
I love improv and for awhile it kept me going. But I&amp;#39;ve missed so many shows and disappointed so many people, I feel like I can&amp;#39;t even show my face in the scene anymore.
I keep thinking about how angry people will be with me for killing myself but I just can&amp;#39;t anymore. I keep imagining myself in people&amp;#39;s arms being hugged and feeling loved but it just doesn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I am a 19 year old male. This is a throw-away account. I could go on for hours talking about my feelings and emotions that might have let me to feel like this. I am very confused on my sudden ""depressed"" state (I don't know if I should call it that). I won't be going into an enormous story of the potential causes of this as that would need me to try and comprehend all these factors that I myself can't even comprehend. I am sorry about the sentence structuring, choice of words and grammar as this is more of a rant and I am very out of energy. I just need some help.

This whole thing strangely started 2 days ago after an event called the ""contact music festival"" in Vancouver Canada ended. Before then I was fine mentally. I go to college and love the subject I am studying (although I do question sometimes if it is worth the risk pursuing this career path as it is very competitive and a financial and social and mental risk to pursue). I liked doing certain activities and interacting with people. To be honest, I haven't been the happiest person for a bit as I did have a very rough academic semester, but I have been fairly good mentally.

The festival was for two nights and I did happen to take MDMA for both nights with three hours of sleep in between (I say this because it could be a cause but I don't know). I had never taken MDMA before in my life or any other hard drug, and barely drink. I do smoke weed but not very occasionally. I had fun both nights, although I was very tired from the lack of sleep on my second night. At the end of the second night when it was all over I basically went home because of jaw pain (side effect of MDMA) and just a lot of neck pain from carrying people on my shoulder.

After I got home. Something just felt off about me. It's so hard for me to comprehend or even describe, but I got home and just had a sense of immense sadness (this may have been from the side effects of MDMA as it is common). It felt like that event was a 2 week escape from reality and now I snapped back into it. Though I was very tired so I just went to sleep.

The next morning (yesterday) was such a terrible day for me. I don't know why but I woke up and felt out of energy, not in the mood to do anything and I kind of just layed in bed for a couple hours. I had a good amount of sleep. I was completely disinterested in everything. I don't remember much of it even though it was yesterday, but I did nothing until my friend wanted to go shop so I decided to go just for the walk and see if that would make me feel better. I am usually a very social person so my friend noticed when I was silent for most of our time going shopping. I said it was because I was tired. I was indeed tired but also just at a very saddened state and I felt like returning home and letting all these impulsive depressive emotions out.

After I finally got home I went to my room and everything hit me

I spent many hours there just crying. I had completely lost interest in everything in my life. I felt confused in life now and was unsure of what I want to do. I felt so worthless and tired and I feel like life is so meaningless. All my hobbies that I enjoy and my subject in school that I loved for many years; I am starting to lose interest in everything. I spent about 4 hours crying spontaneously about many many thoughts and emotions. I've had some suicidal thoughts before but they were pretty mild compared to now. I pretty much cried until 1 am and was so tired that I fell asleep.

I woke up this morning feeling really good actually. I was confused on why I was so sad. I figured all the crying must of helped flush out some toxins and the MDMA long term side effects must have been the cause. I don't know when it happened, but I was on my computer and all these emotions from the previous day suddenly came back, and it was just as bad. I cried a lot just as before, and my suicidal thoughts were back. I would like to note that although I do get these suicidal thoughts, I would never commit it because I couldn't imagine what my parents would go through if I did it. Anyways, now here I am at night typing this out because I am scared that this is going to continue.

My side effects/feelings/emotions have been:

\-Constant sadness

\-sense of loneliness

\-constant fatigue/laziness/lack of motivation to do anything

\-anxiety

\-spontaneous crying

\-loss of appetite/nausea (I have not ate much for the past two days)

\-difficulty concentrating

\-constant negative thoughts

\-occasional suicidal thoughts

I'm sorry if this all sounds so stupid. It's probably so confusing to you reading this. I know two days isn't a long time at all but for me it has felt like a week. There is so much more I could talk about that might fill in the gaps but I won't bother unless you want me to since I could go on rambling about my mindset. I just thought it would be good to post this to make myself feel better. This might seem like I am going through an existential crisis, but I wouldn't categorize it as that since I have dealt with that before, and it was more of a chilling idea than the breakdown I am having right now.

,depression_help,"Sorry for the shitty formatting, I've been crying all day.

I spent the past three and half years completing grueling classwork and an undergraduate thesis (project) in order to graduate a semester early. I did this because I wanted to save the money for grad school admissions. Me and my professor have a good relationship but I took a couple of days off for my mental health and for GREs and TOEFLs. Also I was taking classes in order to graduate early. My work wasn't a lot because we had limited GPU resources on campus and my code took a while to finish. I'm also writing two more papers with this professor who I really love to work with. But they are taking a bit of time because of research work and the other work I mentioned previously

Today we had to hand in our final reports and she told me that she didnt think I did enough to deserve an A. Do note that the credits for this version of project is lesser than the whole semester kind. But I digress. I felt shattered because if I get an A- or B I wont be on the honors list which I have tried to work hard for. I've gotten so involved in trying to raise my GPA ever since my depression fueled 12th grade. I still wanna write those paper but my professor doesnt believe that I'll be committed to it even though j graduate. I believe that this is all a big misunderstanding and she is basically warning me but my brain is telling me I'm useless, I'll never come out on top et cetera.

I'm so obsessed with grades. I used to score so well when I was a kid and everyone told me i was 'gifted'. I become so complacent until hardships hit me in high school which spiraled into depression and above average grades and these 3.5 I've been trying to prevent such a situation again. Deep down I believe it was rush of feeling 'unique' when people called me smart. I used to think I was special. Boy was I wrong. It's probably my irrational mind but is life worth living if you are 'average'?. 

Sometimes I wish that I could cease existence but I love my friends and family and they would be horrible devastated but at the same time my brain tells me that I'll just fade away from everyone's memories. I'm scared of being a no body. I know its stupid.

I'm 21 but I'm still a child inside. My dad had to call up my professor to figure why I was bawling. It's so embarrassing that I could die. He did it out of concern but my brain again twists shit out of nothing.

,depression_help,"I don’t really write poetry but the few people I’ve showed said it was really good. Wanted to put it out there. If you take the time to read it thank you 


I start waking planning to walk till I’m distant from my thoughts 
A man comes up and walks beside me 
He has no face, no body, no shape or size 
I can’t see his presence, but I can feel it 
I’ll call him the shadow man 

He tells me he knows my darkest secrets 
He knows my pain and my temptations 
He says he can make them disappear, that he can help 
All I have to do is follow him and do as he says 
Skeptical yet desperate, I follow 

He brings me to a place that he calls the happy place 
“This is where all the pain becomes non existent” he says 
Where I can finally be okay 
He shows me around 
I look down at such a far drop wondering why he brought me here 
I’m terrified yet intrigued 
For some reason I trust the shadow man 

He tells me what I need to do 
He says to sit and lean back 
That I will fall until my seemingly never ending pit of misery comes to an end filled with peace and serenity
I look down at the drop as my heart starts to race 
I tell him that I’m skeptical, I don’t know if I can do it 
“It’s simple, I’m your friend, just trust me”he says 
It didn’t take much to convinced me 
I trust the shadow man 

I unhook my hands from the rails that are holding onto the fear of falling 
As I start to lean back it hits me
The shadow man is not my friend 
He’s out to get me 
I quickly clench back onto the railing, catching myself mid fall 

I tell him I can’t do it, I want to go home
He screams at me out of frustration as my hands begin shaking out of fear
He tells me there’s no way out, no other options
His words pierce my ears like nails on a chalkboard 
They surround me inching closer and closer, trapping me in what felt like a ring of fire  

I refuse to listen to the convincing lies he tells 
Although I’m terrified I start to walk away 
As I walk I can hear him calling me back from a distance 
His words become elastics, the farther I go, the harder they pull me back, the louder they get 
I refuse to listen
Just keep walking I tell myself 

I hear his footsteps start to creep up behind me
He doesn’t want to let me go 
I start to run, terrified to look back 
I run till my legs begin to cramp
I get far enough away but I can still hear his voice faintly in the distance saying “I will be back, you can’t hide from me”

,depression_help,"Ok so I've spent the last 2 years working on my mental health. By no means am I healthy but I'm definitely improving. Along that 2 year road I picked up some things along the way.

1. It's not an easy fight.

Depression can kick your ass you all probably know that I already. But for those who have a hard time fighting it here is something that helps me. 

Everytime I hit a depressive state I like to imagine I'm on a medieval battlefield. I'm a brave warrior on one knee breathing heavy and across is my personification of my depression. Clearly I feel like it could win at anytime. But then I remember every last soul who cares for me and the people relying on me for protection. They all manifest behind me and with them I feel stronger. We may isolate our selves from our friends but whether or not we are a burden to them they choose to stand by our side and support us. Which leads to point 2.

2. Real friends Understand 

So I never truly realized how blessed I am with the people around me. Friends just being there makes the continuing fight against depression easier. Having a network to talk about your problems with can actually ease your mind alot. I would recommend if you dont have one already get a really blunt friend who isn't afraid to tell you how it really is. I have had one for 15 years and he is like a brother to me. But sometimes we need to hear the blunt truth of things to get it through our heads. Which actually  leads to point 3.

3.Quit lying to yourself.

Every human being depressed or not immediately will provide an answer to questions in our own minds. I found this out when my relationship was on the rocks recently we know what we want but sometimes we are afraid what the answer entails whether it be cutting negative people out of our lives that has been there for years or facing fears that have controlled us for so long. Listen to your inner thoughts and what they say sometimes the answer is a lot simpler than we make it out to seem.

4. Fears are scary but we are strong

Being depressed is a hard life and personally I dont think it ever will truly just stop. It's a a hard fact to swallow but it is that a fact. It's a chemical imbalance in our brains and we will always have it. But with that we grow stronger strong enough to face fears we never thought we would overcome strong enough to put the knife down and live. If you are still here reading this now you can still fight and if you come this far dont give up. Perseverance is the key to your own betterment. 

5. Take care of yourself 

This is personally a hard one for me simply because my relationship with my bed is probably the most solid relationship I have when depression hits me hard. Lol but seriously I wont shower I wont eat I wont do the things that bring me joy I wont go outside. It's a fight to just go into work somedays. But force yourself to take care of yourself. If you can manage that 9 times out of 10 your day will start to get better.

6. Cut the critical thinking 

A common misconception in our society is that failure is not an option. It's okay to fail it's okay to mess up. It's how we get back up that defines us. Our life and society is rough and we beat us to the ground and hold us there if we let it. But it's okay to be on the ground for a second after a heavy hit. It's ok to recuperate from a hard moment in life. But just remember you gotta get back up.

7. It's okay to live for someone else if you find it hard living for yourself. 

This is a thought process that kept me alive through my darkest times. I used to hold no value for my life. I used to hate every aspect of my being. I wanted to bite the bullet and end it. But then my girlfriend and her son stepped into my life. And they needed me. They needed my strength my resolve and most importantly my love. Dont let anyone tell you that living for someone else is wrong. If it keeps you alive and holds you up like a crutch until those thoughts return and you start feeling useful again so be it.

8. Treat yourself

Whether you feel like you did enough or not reward yourself for days you break through the darkness. Get a Starbucks coffee buy a new video game go dye your hair whatever it is dont forget to treat yourself 

9.Selfishness is inherently a bad thing

If you do something for yourself and some busts your balls about screw them. As long as selfishness is hurting someone else there is nothing inherently wrong with it. It's okay to have a day in by yourself.

Anyway that is all I can think of. Now this may not apply to everyone and that's fine we all come from different walks of life and things apply differently to each lifestyle. But If one of these things helped you I would love to hear about it.😁 or if you just wanna talk about something or need an ear I'm willing to listen.

,depression_help,"Hi everyone,

I hope this sub is the right place to post this - if not, please let me know where this should go.

The past month I've been struggling to help myself. I'm determined to get my life back on track and live my life for the better.

As some context, over the years I experienced a lot of curve-balls that threw me off my game - the past three were especially painful. But I'm not sure what happened recently because suddenly I feel like I've snapped, as if I've just woken up from some strange dream. 

I'm determined to help myself get better, and I'm trying to figure that out.

Here's a list of habits I want to break out of and overcome and would really appreciate advice from people who managed to change these:

* **Worrying about everything I say or do out of fear of being bullied or targeted.** I've kind of become a bit closed up and afraid to speak up because of past experiences.
* **Be ok with wearing my heart on my sleeve.** I want to go back to being ok with being open and expressive, even if that means sometimes there might be people who will want to take advantage hurt you.
* **Learn how to establish boundaries and not feel bad if I tell someone no.**
* **To not give up on the things I started and see them through.** I've noted down that the main thoughts I have when I start to give up on something (whether it's a project, a habit, or a hobby) stem from self-doubt, little to no motivation, occasional pessimistic beliefs about the final outcome, and a general disbelief in my abilities. On that note:
* **Stop giving up easily, especially when I'm feeling jaded and sad.** I've noticed that my emotions can have a huge weight on me at times, so when I'm feeling crushed I'll sometimes just go lie down because of how sad and disheartened I feel.
* **Fix the way I speak to myself.** I'm trying to break away from the negative self-speak but I've found it hard to do, especially at points where I feel my lowest and I just want to throw in the towel.
* **Be supportive and patient - especially if it relates to my progress with anything I'm doing or dealing with.** My experiences have turned me into a very impatient person, and this is something I want to change because the old me was more patient and kind with myself.
* **Stop second guessing myself and putting myself down.** It's gotten to the point where I've started doubting even my own reactions to things. There's this piece of me that's become cynical, for lack of a better term, and I want to change that to at least constructive criticism.  
* **Turn my destructive energy to a productive one.** Feeling overwhelmed with everything is a pain in the butt, and it's gotten to the point where I'm engaging in unhealthy habits like nail biting, neglecting my skincare routine, and procrastinating. I've noticed that a lot of the time the destructiveness kicks in when I'm reminded of past experiences and past failures, when I'm unhappy with what I've produced (I'm a perfectionist), comparing my progress to other people (which isn't practical), and generally negative thoughts.
* **Combat my perfectionism and aim for both progress and contentment**. I've become really hard on myself and I know that logically I'm demanding too much out of myself when it comes to goal setting. I think a lot of is because I'm comparing myself to others' progress.
* **Be more social and in touch with my loved ones.** The past two years I've kind of become withdrawn and have been struggling to maintain proper contact - sometimes it's even sporadic. The thing I am most grateful for is that my friends and my family have been very supportive and understanding about why I've changed, so they're patient with me. But this makes me feel so sad and guilty because I love them a lot but I feel so overwhelmed helping myself that I don't know how to be there for these wonderful people. On a somewhat related note:
* **Not be afraid to put myself out there and take a chance on people.** I don't just mean this in a dating context but even when it comes to meeting new people. I'm always afraid of getting close to someone again who would turn out to take advantage of me, put me down, and waste my time. I know logically not everyone is out to do this, but emotionally I'm afraid of getting hurt because the recovery of getting over them is painful and exhausting.

&amp;#x200B;

And here's a list of things that I have tried or I'm currently trying - I'm open to more things I should try to discover what can help me grow stronger:

* **I just created two self-care journals.** One is aimed towards fostering a sense of love, security, and motivation. This book is being filled with things like reassuring reminders, kind quotes, and the like. I'm also treating it as a critic free zone when it comes to my hobbies like writing and drawing. This is because my first step is to get back into the things that brought me joy so I can use it as a use it as a healing tool - once I'm doing better and I also learned how to give myself objective constructive criticism then I'll move on to growth and change. My second journal is to keep track of my negative moods and thoughts, and address them constructively. My idea to ""vomit"" whatever I'm feeling, whether as a sketch or as words, and when I'm feeling balanced I'll look at what I've penned down - break it down to what triggered the mood (so I can keep track), address the thoughts as if a wise loved one was talking to me, and what advice they would offer that I could try the next time around.
* **Used Daylio to track my mood but stopped it.** I've tried using Daylio since the start of 2019, but I keep stopping and starting because I noticed I was using Daylio more as a way to keep track of my negative moods rather than focus on positive ones. So I've since deleted the app. 
* **Struggling to keep track of positive boosters.** This was something I found easier to do when I was still in my very early 20s. Almost every day I would keep track of things that made me happy, such as things I was grateful for, things I admired about myself, or something that made me happy that day. It was always nice to go back and read things after a period of time or during a low period of my life. However, over the past three years I can't bring myself to do this anymore. It feels so forced and so I don't commit, even though I know from experience that this was helpful to my mental health - it kept me upbeat, motivated, and hopeful. Is there another way to do this again without it feeling insincere and forced?
* **Trying to relearn time management.** In the past I used to use check lists and tracking apps to help me get things done throughout the day. Now I'm struggling to use them because they leave me feeling overwhelmed. I tried to use reminders and bullet-journaling but I stopped because I noticed they were triggering stress and demotivation instead. What could I be doing differently?
* **Meditation.** This one is something I'm trying to make into a habit but I'm struggling with to the point of frustration. A lot of the time I noticed my mind is determined to wander off, even with guided meditation. It's like my brain can somehow cancel out the voice and take me on an unwanted trip. Is this something that's happened to you too?

With regards to advice, if it helps paint a picture I'm 29, I'm working full-time, and I'm also pursuing my Masters.

&lt;p&gt;I hope this sub is the right place to post this - if not, please let me know where this should go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past month I&amp;#39;ve been struggling to help myself. I&amp;#39;m determined to get my life back on track and live my life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some context, over the years I experienced a lot of curve-balls that threw me off my game - the past three were especially painful. But I&amp;#39;m not sure what happened recently because suddenly I feel like I&amp;#39;ve snapped, as if I&amp;#39;ve just woken up from some strange dream. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m determined to help myself get better, and I&amp;#39;m trying to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a list of habits I want to break out of and overcome and would really appreciate advice from people who managed to change these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worrying about everything I say or do out of fear of being bullied or targeted.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve kind of become a bit closed up and afraid to speak up because of past experiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be ok with wearing my heart on my sleeve.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to go back to being ok with being open and expressive, even if that means sometimes there might be people who will want to take advantage hurt you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn how to establish boundaries and not feel bad if I tell someone no.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To not give up on the things I started and see them through.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#39;ve noted down that the main thoughts I have when I start to give up on something (whether it&amp;#39;s a project, a habit, or a hobby) stem from self-doubt, little to no motivation, occasional pessimistic beliefs about the final outcome, and a general disbelief in my abilities.

,depression_help,"I don't really know what anyone can tell me, when my Psych and Therapist couldn't. I guess some part of me really wants to hold on and is looking for just any excuse. I can't seem to find it though.

I was supposed to start University again this January after a 2 year long hiatus. I took a break for mental health. During this time, things got worse and I attempted on my life three times, self harmed, and drug abuse. Last 8ish months I took it upon myself to get help and have been taking meds, seeing a Psych and therapist.

I have gotten much better. I have a greater understanding of myself, I have coping strategies that aren't destructive and I am able to talk to people and potentially build meaningful friendships. 

Though that is clearly not enough. Due to my complete stupidity I failed in submitting documents to my Uni on time and now most of the courses I wanted are full. I still haven't gotten to choose my classes and won't until the holidays end (Jan 2nd) while classes start Jan 7th.

This stupidity has cost me my whole life. I don't know what to do or where to go now. Maybe I am just being a bitch and struggling to end my life. I don't know. Not being able to go back means 8 months of doing nothing. I can't get a job (no experience and my city has a terrible job market) and my therapy ends tomorrow. I will be getting depressed every single day and probably end up back where I was.

,depression_help,"I'm not suicidal. I never have been. However, I'm still struggling, and I'm starting to think that nothing will actually help.

Last year I fought and won against cancer, so at least that's over with. Since then, though, I've felt spacey and out of my body to a very high degree. I've always had this spaceyness about me since I could very first remember, but it's never gotten this bad for this long. Not only did I lose a year of my life last year, but even though treatment has ended, I feel like I've lost this year, too.

I don't really want to talk about it anymore. Everyone keeps telling me it's normal, so I gave up the fight. Recently I've struggled with the temptation to further isolate myself from everyone. I've thought about cutting even my very closest friends out of my life. I don't really find joy in the things I usually find joy in anymore. I don't want to draw, I don't want to go outside, I don't want to talk to people, I don't want to do anything anymore.

I'm either experiencing lows where I feel like I could lock myself away and never come out, or highs that feel like literal drugs. Either that or extreme (always internal) anger/energy in small bursts, or complete and utter apathy. I don't know what's going on in my head anymore, it feels like a muddled mess.

At first I thought therapy would help. Everyone says it does. Heck, I've recommended it to friends, and it HAS worked for them. But it didn't really seem to do much for me. I was on one of my highs back then, so I of course assumed that things were always going to be okay from that point on. I stopped therapy and things WERE good. They were good for a long time, in fact. Then it all crumbled again recently. My next conclusion was that I there was something wrong with my brain, itself. Meds may be able to fix that, right? So I'm still in the process of getting meds (thanks, holidays. Docs are now taking 20 years to do anything remotely productive), but I'm starting to think that meds aren't going to fix all my problems and that I'll just be like this for the rest of my life, however long that is. It feels like hiding.

Last year I gained confidence and discovered who I was in the midst of the crisis. This year I've lost it. I don't know who I am anymore or how I'm feeling. I don't think I like myself anymore. I'm unsatisfied with my actions and behaviours towards others, but at the same time, I don't know how to fix them... Or even if I have the motivation to try.

Apologies for the vent. Like I said, I'm not in a dire situation or anything, I just wanted to chat. I've been staying up later and later and I just realized that maybe it's because I don't want to be alone in a cold, dark room for the length of time it takes me to fall asleep.

I don't think I really want advice right now, just someone to talk to. Someone who will lift me up a little bit. It's extremely late and I don't want to fall asleep alone. I know a lot of subs will almost encourage depressive thoughts/behaviours, so I thought I'd come seek out a more positive place and hope for something uplifting.

I’m trying so hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, it’s just been really hard. I understand “that’s life it’s hard” lol but tired of feeling weighted down almost all the time. No matter how many times I tell myself that other people deal with this and it doesn’t make you a bad person I end up feeling guilty regardless. Thanks for reading if you got this far, I hope someone understands.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hello everyone, 

My english is not on point so it is possible that I don't make a lot of sense, but I just need to talk about my feelings and I don't want to bother my friends at 2 am. 


So I'm in the middle of a breakdown.

I'm 21.

I've always been that charismatic smiling dude, always happy, always laughing.. having success, helping others....

I work a lot and I have a lot of responsabilities at work. It is a part time job, but because of my responsabilities it's basically full time. I feel a lot of pressure to perform well and since I'm basically alone to do the job of 2-3, this is insanely demanding. But I have very little to nothing gratitude from my superiors despote the fact that I sacrifice a lot of thing to meet expectations but I also love the job and my coworkers...

Also, I am a full time student at University which is also putting a lot of pressure on me. Because of my job I don't have enough time to study and my marks are lower than what i'm used to have... I've always well performed at school.

My sleep schedule is also fucked up because of anxiety, stress and insomnia.

I'm basically always sprinting under pressure with very few breaks. 

But this is the problem: break. Damn holidays.

For some reasons, I thought that it would be nice, relaxing, having fun with friends and family... As it should... But damn I was wrong. Break from school and work put me in a weird and bad mood... I'm used to have a fast life so stopping everything really changed my mood...

and when the girl I love like crazy told me that she doesn't love me,  I know her since a long time and she's the most wonderful person I know.. but damn it hurted me and everything fell apart. And really I just blame myself for interpreting her words or actions for love.. and almost regret to have told her that I love her... we're still really close friends so that's cool, but it's still hurting.

I started talking about my feelings, school, job to a friend during a party and I  melted in tears... I broke down and realized: I can't continue like that.

Because of all that, I started questioning  everything, I'm crying a lot in my car , in my bed... I feel like dying, nothing seems to excite me, I feel like I'm suffocating, I have difficulties breathing, I feel like I have a big iron ball in my stomach, my heart
rate is fast even when I do nothing... I eat nothing, I can't sleep...I just want to hug my friends, talk to them, cry on their shoulders...

I tried telling a friend, and got the classic “don’t think that way / just be happy” thing...

,depression_help,"Just broke up with my girlfriend about 2 months ago. It was completely my fault, I was incredibly insecure with myself and started talking to random girls online. Unfortunately she found out more than once, and she left because of it.

Other than that, she always thought I was perfect for her. I loved her completely. And I was so patient with her. We did everything together, really, and it was a great 6 years. But now, as I'm going to therapy to find out what the hell was so wrong with me, I realized that while I loved her 100%, I didn't love myself. I was always so anxious to make her feel loved that I wasn't focusing on what I wanted. Sure, I was happy, but I was blind to the delusion of me being happy by making her happy.

I even had plans to marry her.

But, as I said, my actions led to the worst outcome I could ever imagine. I feel like I lost it all. No just her, but her family. Her friends. Her world. And now that I realized my mistake I vowed never to do something so stupid like that again. And this therapy is definitely helping to bury my anxiety. Still, I'm incredibly depressed. I'm just still grieving with the loss, and damn, it feels impossible to forgive myself.

Like I said, the therapy is helping a ton. And I'm also talking to people I know, friends of mine, coworkers... and literally everyone of them have been extremely important. I turned into a fresh gym rat, too, and it's really helping me find myself in such a dark time in my life.

I'm pretty sure there's something else I can do. I need to turn my life around. I want to be happy again. I want to move on. I want to know what it feels like to love myself. What else do you guys suggest? I'd love to hear what you guys like to do to fight your depression.

,depression_help,"My LO is 4 months old. Had a nasty case of PPD but got on medication and felt better. Felt better than I have in about 10 years actually. No anxiety no depression. Part of it was of course the medication but I think a big part of it was not having to go to work every day. I've worked in retail since I was 14 and have never had a break. In general I've always been anxious and depressed. 

I'm back tomorrow and I've been crying for days. A big part of it is having to leave LO. I'm worried she's not going to love me anymore. I worry she's going to love her daycare provider more. I worry I'm going to miss out on all of these milestones that seem to be happening every day. I'm worried about affording it all. We can't afford for me to stay home and we can barely afford daycare if I work 45 hours a week. 

The other part of it is just going back to work. I always felt anxious before having to work but it was just what I had to do. It still is, but after having so much time off it just feels impossible. I've finally felt happy and calm. I'm not ready to lose that feeling again. I cannot find a job in my area that will pay me what I make where I am now so leaving isn't an option. My DH is incredibly supportive but there's nothing that can be done. 

How do people manage kids and work. How do moms afford to stay home. It sounds so cliche but how am I supposed to balance it all. Social interactions just feel so forced and it feels like after 4 months of being myself at home I won't be able to function. I feel desperate and panicked.

I feel numb all the time like i&amp;#39;m not even participating in life and it scares me because I don&amp;#39;t want to look back and realize that i&amp;#39;ve wasted my life being terribly sad.&lt;/p&gt;

I know that this is also my fault that I was not trying to seek further help, because I was simply too afraid and having financial problem to do that, I skipped my therapy, and not even trying to reach any of friends to help me out because I was too embarrassed. I should&amp;#39;ve just overcome my fears and try harder.
I don&amp;#39;t know what am I supposed to do. I&amp;#39;m too afraid to ask for helpbnow because this is super late and they&amp;#39;ll just say that I&amp;#39;m only making excuses. I feel like I just wanna die or get killed.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Have you ever heard “Just you are still alive, it means a lot to someone.”?

Do you understand the meaning of it?

I’ll tell you a story. Once upon a time. There was a girl while she was riding a motorcycle in the rain back to her home. She saw a homeless man who was wearing torn clothes walking in the rain. At that time she didn’t think anything. But when she arrived at her home. She asked herself if he would be cold or have a fever. She decided to return to him with a large towel. She rode a motorcycle there around 10 minutes until seeing him. That places they were at that time were very dark and lonely. No one was there except them two. But she didn't feel scared of him at all. His body is very foul. His eyes didn't show anything. At first, she thought that he was dead. But he was still breathing. so she covered him with a large towel and left. She told this story to her sis and she forgot about it. One day she felt that she was worthless. Therefore consulted her sis. And her sis talked about this story. She completely forgot about this. Her sis told her that she was crazy for daring to do that. And this story made her think she is very grateful to that homeless man. That made her felt that she has value because of him. He may be just a homeless man that everyone dislikes. Or maybe somebody called him trash, but for her, she thinks he is her god. He lets her know how much value she is. But she can't tell him and maybe he'll never know how much he has value to her.

And of course, you may not know how much you have value to others.

Let's continue with the second story. Once upon a time, she was sitting alone in the park that she had just come to for the first time. Then suddenly there was a boy who seemed to be the same age as her, he talked to her. He knew that she came here for the first time. And she seemed to know that he was not all there. But she didn’t care or mind him. They talked for 2-3 hours before she left. She couldn’t remember what they were talking about. But at that time, she was very happy. And his conversation is different from others. And she was confident that she couldn't talk about this with usual people. And after that day, she just knew the truth that he has bullied by his friends at school. And was disgusted by many people because he wasn’t just usual like everyone. And she just knew that where she sat that day was the place where women were raped. And she was confident that he talked to her that day. He wanted to help her. For her, he is a hero and her important friend. Of course, she doesn't have a chance to tell him. And he would never know.

And of course. You'll never know what you did, how much does it affect someone.

Let's continue with the third story. This person was her junior and he is a moron. He was close to her mother. That made her knew him. Everyone said he was crazy. Do not mess with him at all. But she didn't care about people's speech. But she liked his actions. He didn't cause anyone to trouble. He was just himself. He could do whatever she wanted to do but couldn't dare to do it. One day, she saw him singing in the public. And that day she had a singing competition at school. She wasn't confident in herself that she could do it. But when she saw him sing without caring for anything. Even though his voice may be bad. But he made her brave enough to sing on that day. She was thankful to him and thought of him as her idol.

And of course. You're just yourself, it makes someone dares to do something.

Do you know Robert John Downey, Jr? If you know him, you probably heard about ""a cheeseburger of Burger King"".

And who made the cheeseburger for him that day? Maybe that person is you. You are saying that you are not involved in someone's change?

And many others. The street sweeper made me run today in the park. The person who eats alone in the cafeteria makes me dare to go alone. People without a job that made me know that why should I study hard. If you think that just being alive, it cannot be useful to others. Maybe you are wrong.

And all the messages that I wrote I'm going to tell you that you are very precious. at least just for me. No matter who you are. Just being alive, I'm very happy. The reason? There's no. When you love someone, do you know why? For me, I don't know. And didn't want to know the reason as well.

And of course, I'm your friend. I can listen to all your problems as if I am your close friends. If you have something uncomfortable. you can talk to me, I'm not a mentor. But I'm ready to listen and feel together with you like your best friend. Don't hesitate to hit me up.

,depression_help,"Hey there guys. 

Right now, I’m in the best relationship I’ve ever been in. He wholeheartedly loves me and showers me with the support I need to get better with my depression. 

But the reason why I want to break up with him is because our sex lives are so different that I’m unhappy with the sex we have. I’ve always wanted something steamy, but I have something so casual. 

So it pains me dearly to leave a man behind in the dust because of sex. We’ve tried to change things for the past year, and the progress is probably at a solid 3%. 

I thought I was gonna marry him, have his children, enjoy my full life with him because we truly are best friends. 

I’ve heard the statistic that sex is only 3% of a relationship and if that’s the case, I’ve been trying to settle for semi decent sex for the past year but it’s really taking a tole on me. 

Now, there are other red flags that I’ve experienced so I don’t feel as guilty as if it were just about sex. I don’t wanna go thru them but just know I’ve seen about 4 red flags that were breakup quality alone.

Now the reason why I’m here, is because I damn well know I won’t be able to function without him. My family is shit at depression support, I’ve moved away from all of my friends, and I’m on my last leg right now from falling into a deep depression spiral. 

I’m convinced my depression is apart of executive functioning disorder and that my anxiety can be cured by working out. However, I can’t get myself out of bed recently. It’s getting worse since it’s basically dark when I wake up and dark when I get home. I’ve stopped taking care of our dog and the responsibility has fallen onto his shoulders. 

I don’t know how to handle my life without him. When I first met him I was in a deep depression and he was the light at the end of the tunnel. I was laughing again. Truly, laughing. 
Now, the tunnel is reappearing and I’m slowly being pulled in.

,depression_help,"Every day I wake up and I'm always feeling low. Every day feels like a hellhole that I have to claw my way out of. 

Most of the time I feel like I can't function as a human being or get out of bed. Let alone work on schoolwork like I'm supposed to. I don't think I've learned anything this year in algebra but I have the ACT this year. But I can hardly muster up the effort to study or concentrate. Even though I worry about it constantly. Even just going outside takes a tremendous amount of effort.
When my depression gets really bad, I tend to have a floaty, dissociative unrealness.

My dad died from a drug overdose recently (we don't know if it's a suicide), and my dog is getting a lot of medical conditions caused by aging, so I'm struggling because of that.

I'm also battling severe gender dysphoria (I'm trans) and I constantly hate my body because of my sex characteristics (I was born female). I constantly want to claw off my chest or just take a knife and cut off my chest, and every time I get gendered as ""she"" by my family hurts. 
Even though I like typically ""girly"" things, I want to die because I was born female.
I don't think I necessarily identify as completely ""male"" but I don't relate to myself as being female either. Because I'm not sure I want to fully transition to male, it makes me scared to tell my family to use the right pronouns for me. (The people in my family are all conservative christians.)
Even though I'm suffering, I feel like I ""have to be doing this for attention"".
The fact that I'm going through this makes me feel like a freak who doesn't deserve love. 

And the family I live with often say things like, ""You should feel grateful because I came all the way out here to pick you up when I could be watching the ball game"", or ""you should feel grateful that we put food on the table for you"". At the same time they won't allow me to get a driver's license or a job while I'm living with them.
It makes me feel like a burden all the time. I feel like a burden because my parents had to take care of me as a baby. I feel like I don't really deserve that kind of love or attention.

All this along with my regular depression (I'm on antidepressants). Every day I wake up and every day I want to die. Every day I feel worthless, I feel hopeless, I feel easily agitated, and my mood can switch back and forth minute to minute. I can feel somewhat decent one minute and the next I can hate the world, and hate people, and want everyone to suffer and hurt in the worst way possible (say, a drive by shooting) before throwing myself off a cliff.

And everyone around me is saying everyone my age fakes their depression for attention, and that 16 is too young to have depression.

Backstory, i've been seeing a psyciatrist since I was 12 until 17. I am now 24. Depression, eating dissorders, attempting suicide. But I became better. That was until last Summer. 
I just got back from a camping trip. Only me and My dog and the high alps. I have never been that happy. But when I got back i crashed. 
Two days after coming back home I had My first panic attack. And it was bad. As in I thought I was done for bad. I reached out to a psyciatrist in the middle of My attack. I wouldn't be alive today if I didnt. 
Been good since. Moved closer to the alps and started studying. This last year has been great.


But for now im in my bed. I have spent the whole weekend sleeping. My chest hurt and I feel angry all the time. Angry and sad. 
What triggered it this time? A fight with a friend. A bad fight. The only thing holding me from hanging mysef was that I wanted to walk My dog first ""who knew when someone would notice that I was dead. She would be stuck inside for hours, maybe even days. She deserved One last walk."" That cleared ny head. 
Since then i've had smaller attacks almost daily. No patterns. And it hurts and im scared. I don't want to feel this way. I feel like I want to cry and Scream. But I can't. I can't do anything.

I can&amp;#39;t think, I can&amp;#39;t stop crying and everything just feels so much worse than before and I really wanna talk to a psychiatrist because my invasive thoughts are so much worse. I&amp;#39;m currently cuddling with my other dog, the brother to the other, with his collar in my hand. I can&amp;#39;t and don&amp;#39;t want to let him go. He was my little buddy. I just hope he had a great life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for spelling errors or anything and the post in general, I just need to vent cause holding in just makes it hurt so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I had learned the news, there had been things seeming off. I used to excel at reading at writing but now I kept making mistakes typing and stuttering and I just couldn't think properly. My sleep patterns are going bonkers.

,depression_help,"I have always been very critical of the suicidal community. I always thought of suicide as selfish. Now, this is selfish and ignorant of me, but I am starkly comfortable with death. I don't know if I'm suicidal, but I'm so fucking scared. I have always been pressured to be the best. The win all the time. Well, I didn't do so well in high school. I listen to the news and I lose hope at a life that isn't in STEM. I fear what my life will become. I've lied time and time to make my extended family happy. I want people around me to be inspired, but no longer. I have concluded that racism, lies, and hopelessness will be the end of me. I recently got a girlfriend and I think I see a future with only her. I don't lie to her. I'm honest with her. She's so much better than me. She's gonna be successful as hell in the future. I like her for her and her personality and the way she makes me feel. But I'm lustful and she's overweight a bit, and she has back problems. As much as I want to love her sexually and as much as convince myself so, I just love slim bodies and it's so fucking disgusting of me. It's not even that I don't find her attractive, I'd just prefer her to be skinny and/or athletic, or at least take an initiative towards her well-being and physical attractiveness. I feel like a gold digger. A glory digger. A fucking beta male. Not what I wanted to become. I am a senior in high school. I've become a student leader in so many positions, but as we all know, that's short-lived. I don't want to use my girlfriend, but she likes me a bunch and I like her a bunch, and logically it would make no fucking sense to break up with her.

I always thought of suicide as selfish. Now, this is selfish and ignorant of me, but I am starkly comfortable with death. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m suicidal, but I&amp;#39;m so fucking scared. I have always been pressured to be the best. The win all the time. Well, I didn&amp;#39;t do so well in high school. I listen to the news and I lose hope at a life that isn&amp;#39;t in STEM. I fear what my life will become. I&amp;#39;ve lied time and time to make my extended family happy. I want people around me to be inspired, but no longer. I have concluded that racism, lies, and hopelessness will be the end of me. I recently got a girlfriend and I think I see a future with only her. I don&amp;#39;t lie to her. I&amp;#39;m honest with her. She&amp;#39;s so much better than me. She&amp;#39;s gonna be successful as hell in the future. I like her for her and her personality and the way she makes me feel. But I&amp;#39;m lustful and she&amp;#39;s overweight a bit, and she has back problems. As much as I want to love her sexually and as much as convince myself so, I just love slim bodies and it&amp;#39;s so fucking disgusting of me. It&amp;#39;s not even that I don&amp;#39;t find her attractive, I&amp;#39;d just prefer her to be skinny and/or athletic, or at least take an initiative towards her well-being and physical attractiveness. I feel like a gold digger. A glory digger. A fucking beta male. Not what I wanted to become. I am a senior in high school. I&amp;#39;ve become a student leader in so many positions, but as we all know, that&amp;#39;s short-lived. I don&amp;#39;t want to use my girlfriend, but she likes me a bunch and I like her a bunch, and logically it would make no fucking sense to break up with her.

,depression_help,"Hey, no idea if this is the right subreddit for my ""problem"", but let me introduce myself real quick.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 years old, will finish my degree in a few month, some people say I am quite good looking and my height is about 171cm ( 5′ 7″). When I am with my friends I tend to be the funny one, but normally I am a pretty quite person. I work out regularly and try to keep up on a good nutrition.

&amp;#x200B;

So now for my problem. Since me and my girlfriend broke up almost a year ago I am feeling kind of emtpy. I don't really care about anything anymore, most things that used to make me feel really excited and happy just give me some sort of a ""meh""-feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Breaking up with my ex was not bad at all, I got over her pretty well since she turned into a person I really did not love anymore. After the break up I met a few girls and got attached to one pretty quick but she fucked me over super badly. After that it got worse concerning positive feelings in my life. It feels like I haven't slept well in the last 6 months and I feel so energy drained. The only thing that gives me some sort of joy is gaming a few hours with my friends in evening.

&amp;#x200B;

Every girl I've met in the past month basically didn't want me, which made me feel even emptier from the inside. It's not that I am particularly sad or anything, I just feel like I am irrelevant to everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I would be glad if someone could find some helping words for me in this situation.

,depression_help,"Its not offten, typically when something goes wrong that was out of my control. Some days I can deal with it but others like today its just too much. I can't help but think about how my life hasn't changed in any meaningful way sience I moved out of my parent's house, meanwhile all of my siblings have made something of their lives. Meanwhile I can't even work up the motivation to brush my teeth most mornings let alone do something important like figureing out how to get health inssurance. I honnestly feel like I can't better myself, or even help others. It makes me feel like I'm nothing more than a waste of space.

,depression_help,"So I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder around two years ago. It took a while to figure out what meds to take but i now take two different medications together to treat it. Ive told the doctors I can tell its helping, but I feel as if it could do more. But sometimes I tell myself this is as good as its gonna get because these meds wont cure me.

But anyways, onto what this post is really about. Recently I have been in a slump and I’ve been thinking of things about me or things I do that I don’t like. I wrote them down but I don’t know if these are caused by my depression or if its just who i am and i need to come to terms with it. These things include: 
•Serious lack in motivation. For work, class, and fun with friends and family
•Laziness/laying around all day
•Unable to find enjoyment in a lot of things
•Rethinking my relationship with my SO despite her not doing anything necessarily wrong
•Not reaching out or checking up on important people in my life
•I am less talkative than i used to be/Ive become more introverted
•I become envious of people’s financial positions to the point I put myself in a bad mood, and almost resent my friends

,depression_help,"This will be a very **long** and **complicated**, personal problem. As an undergraduate in college, I will try my best to describe it (chances are I'll end up ranting, go all over the place, and confuse you lot).

I don't know if my ego's too big or something (I don't mean ""egotistic"" as in wanting attention for everything or automatically believing I'm better than everyone else around me): I don't enjoy being in the spotlight, but I also don't like being ignored for my contributions in a conversation or a team sport such as Ultimate Frisbee.

I also have trouble being overly expressive of my depressive thoughts (even struggling online) because whenever someone tries to comfort me, it makes me feel like I'm some **terribly dependent victim** in need of serious help, and then (for whatever reason) it feels like a ""cringe moment"" that I could not stand. Hence **the more I try to talk about my feelings, the worse it feels**... and so I rather keep it to myself, aka in my fragile eggshell.

And this comes to learning as well, like, literally learning about ***anything***. My major (homeland and cyber security, I'm trying to grasp on the basics from an introductory textbook but I get fatigued and reluctant reading/absorbing new knowledge), my hobbies (chess, Rainbow Six Siege, writing... but when I feel like I'm stuck repeating the same mistakes over and over, I reject myself trying to look up helpful tips because I feel inferior for whatever reason... whenever I'm reading a tip or a guideline, I feel as if I ***have*** to listen to it no matter what. In other words, I worry what if the tip doesn't work for me in a different yet specific situation? Like listening to people debating politics or reading news, for whatever reason, I just **can't think outside the box or for myself**).

For example with chess, I'm decent at endgames but weak with openings and attacking in the middlegame. If I were to dedicate myself to learning from grandmasters for one day on how they attack and develop in openings, I would feel slightly accomplished, but immediately unmotivated to continue on the following day because I forgot everything I learned the previous day. With situations like this, I can think of possible reasons:

1. **I see everything as a chore**. This isn't a wrong observation, for it could be my poor sleep schedule (my eating habits are okay, so are my exercising/workout sessions, I think?), but I doubt fixing that will get me progress to become a better version of myself. I haven't tried sticking to antidepressants because my dad gets furiously... furious. (Asian parent stereotype of not emphasizing on mental health). Subsequently, I had to take them inconsistently before giving up on them.
2. **I don't have short-term goals.** Heck, I don't even have long term goals. I can only break it down to finding a decent job related to my major that can support food, bills and minor luxury. Every time I start thinking of what I should do in the long term, I stress out because I keep doubting myself. This lack of confidence is due to my **low self-esteem and being highly sensitive/easily emotional** to mental and emotional pain, but also due to my lack of knowledge for anything at all (read the third paragraph). The more I try to think and maybe lazily plan ahead, I hit a mental block on the road and then I feel like I'm on a sick cycle carousel, thinking about the same problems because they're all somehow connected to each other. How am I supposed to find a solution if that solution requires a series of steps to another solution and it goes back to where it all started?
3. **Contrasting background**. My parents and the relatives who took part in raising me for 5-6 years never supported me doing anything different from their standards (of course, this is what all parents do, but in my eyes, they seem a bit too authoritative trying to enforce their influences upon me). Don't get me wrong, they are very caring and educated people. But on the downside, they argue over little things, badmouthing everyone around them behind their backs, and criticizing me in what I would call it: *harsh* enough to discourage me from thinking differently ever again. It may sound general, but their actions might've killed my sense of creativity and courage to even speak about my thoughts in front of friends and peers in academic settings because it gives me the vibe that I'll be wrongly judged for being ""stupid"" or ""uneducated"" and never reach out to me again. Thus, learning becomes hard because I'll only absorb information on a literal basis and not apply it to anything, rendering it useless in my brain until I forget about the information.

Nowadays I think so lowly of myself that I've developed suicidal thoughts; I value myself less and less, and these depressing thoughts haunt me every day. I can't find myself learning new things anymore, or that I am, but so damn *slow* that it's not enough to land me on an independent life once I leave college. The vicious cycle of my inner struggles has manifested onto me as someone who is forever a prisoner of his past.

However, I still lack the motivation to study, to go out with friends, and all I've been doing besides going to class it's playing video games to keep my mind busy and  to avoid my responsibilities. Exams are in three weeks and I haven't even studied yet or feel the energy to start. I try to but I just can't concentrate or memorize at all and find my efforts useless, to kept on avoiding touching the books.  I really thought I was ""cured"" because my mood wasn't a mess anymore, but today I just realized my situation hasn't changed much from how it used to be: I still isolate myself, find everything boring and meaningless, have no interest for anything and feel lonely, still without energy/motivation to socialize or change my situation. I'm not like I used to be 3 years ago before my depression. I was wondering if someone has experienced this. I just feel like I'm a lazy brat who is been procrastinating all this time but I just don't know what's wrong with me. I've always been a good student. I'm on my fourth year of med school and I feel so overwhelmed and with no illusion for my degree anymore. Every time I think about exams I panic because I've had such a rough time, specially last year, trying to pass all subjects and fighting my depression at the same time and my self- confidence is so messed up. Still I feel I'm just a spoiled brat trying to justify somehow her procrastination. But honestly, I don't recognize myself. My family is putting pressure into me more than I already do because med school is expensive and the stress is killing me.  However I don't think leaving my degree would be of help... I just don't know what to do. Is it too early for my motivation and will to do things to recover? Or I've just got used to my own disease and got lazy?

Stress and Depressed.....I just want to feel better

I don't know what to do. I never want to leave my house unless its for work, doctors, food, or something that is a necessity. I have completely stopped all habits, even bad (not really by choice, since when I am not working I just sit inside and play video games, watch movies. I tell myself many times I want to ""end my life"". But honestly, I am too much of a coward and scared to do something like that....what I mean is I want this part of my life to end. Every now and then, I get this feeling of euphoria. I feel on top of the world and so excited, I am confused at what I should do next. It does not happen often, but when it does, it's only for a few shorts mins. So short, I can't figure out a way to replicate it on command. I do not know what triggers it. Just the thoughts in my head seem to align with the stars and I just feel good. Literally better feeling than any drink or drug has ever done for me.

I am trying my best. My depression was so bad about a year ago, I was applying for jobs in my degree field (Sports Management). I would get an email inquiring about an interview. I would respond with comments that I am not worth it, I don't deserve it, I don't know what I would do if I was given the position. etc. It sounds like I want someone to feel sorry for me, but I dont. I have no rational why I think like that, but I do. I sit in my room contemplating what goals and what I want to do, but actually putting things in motion to accomplish those goals is a daunting task. I download music and still collect music because I want to get back into djing. However, I tell myself I am going to do what it takes to get back out there and spin some tunes. I just can't. Whenever I log on my computer and tell myself I am going to sort through and organize my music, I just put it off.

I currently take medicine and currently see a psychiatrist. Stopped seeing counselor because the way she was talking to me was not cool. Plus, I live near a University Hospital, which is also known as a teaching hospital. Many of the doctors, and employees in general, are still in grad school or literally just graduated. They have little to no experience. And because they are a teaching hospital, you have to roll with one of there younger doctors, even though they have senior physicians that oversee them.

I hope this post can help someone and help me. I would like for it to just blow up and be a post that never goes away. I want to do something good and I want to overcome this.

One other strange thing is talking and hanging out around people makes me feel amazing. I feel great. Common sense would say I would try and do that more. Even though in my mind and heart I want, I just cant force myself to go to a movie, or go for a walk, etc. It's like the most simplistic tasks take so much effort. Think of it has having your car stuck in the mud, foot slammed on the gas pedal. You have people pushing your vehicle to become unstuck and your pedal to the metal, but you aint moving no where. When you do finally move, you slide farther than you were before. Thats my life in a nutshell.

Been depressed for my whole life. Had a really hard time growing up (not many friends, being ostracized), and compensated by focusing on school, which I was always good at. Depression runs in my family. Never felt like I had a community or a support system. Tried therapy as a teen, but I felt judged by therapists I went to, which made things harder.

This bled into relationships - feelings of self loathing and depression tended to push people away. Everyone I ever dated cheated on me or left me for a guy (I’m a queer woman), which made my self esteem worse (being cheated on is bad enough, but when you're depressed about being queer, being left for a guy tends to validate your feelings of worthlessness about being queer - that's another story for another post).

I've been in a relationship now for over a decade, married. Learned end of 2018 that my wife cheated on me with a guy. My biggest trigger for self-loathing/hatred. I’ve been in therapy since, on antidepressants, which kind of help, but I’m still angry and sad a lot. I understand through therapy that my depression set up a situation where she felt alone in the relationship, but I feel like, while I’m healing and trying to be better, I don’t really get supported by my wife.

It feels right now that she’s way more on edge and trusts me less than when I was in a way worse place - almost like, the more I’m getting better and healing, the less trust and support I feel. I want her to feel safe, and I'm glad she's working on figuring out how to do that, but it feels like she somehow is less supportive today, when I'm proving myself and improving myself, than she was when I was at my most depressed and treating her and our relationship way worse.

I think she does still love me, I know I still love her even with all this, but we're in a really dark time, holidays add so much stress, and we're both trying to heal from things that end up sometimes in conflict.

But to sum up, I kind of feel like I'm doing this all on my own, and I want to keep being better and getting better, but don't know how to do that without feeling any support from the person who matters most.

Assuming things stay the same for a while, and I think they will, anything that anyone can suggest, even if it’s like “read this great book” or an activity or coping mechanism or something aside from therapy and pills would be great. Or if anyone got out of anything similar and is doing better now. Or if anyone just has a positive thought to send my way. I do want to feel better, and I'm willing to be proactive about it.

My name is Jacob I’m 21 and a student in college. I’ve battled with depression for most of my life, it started when I was about 14 I think and has come in waves ever since. I can’t even really describe why either it’s just some days I’m ok and other days I’m just there, you know? Most of my problems come from lack of social interaction I think. I’m a pretty introverted person when it comes to new faces, but with people I know and I’m comfortable around I’m super energetic, goofy, and just dumb for lack of a better term haha. But when I’m in classes or around people or out on the town I don’t know what it is. If I don’t have an enabler, like a friend I’m comfortable with, or I’m just having a good time I just can’t bring myself to say a word. The way I described it to my dad, who’s way more outgoing than me, is that it’s like I’m an extrovert trapped inside of an introvert, if that makes sense? All I want to do is talk to people but I can’t get over what would happen if they don’t like me or such. All I’ve ever wanted is for people to like me but I just can’t get over the fear of what happens if they shut me down, think I’m boring, or other things.

And as such I suffer the consequences, I’m lonely and my depression from lack of socializing comes back. I live alone right now, it’s nice but I hate the downtime. And I know I should get out and do things but I just can’t. I’m constantly tired. I guess I’m not as depressed as other people are, but I’d like some advice if you could give me some. I’m all ears.

,depression_help,"I've come here seeking advice as I can't cope with how I feel anymore. I'm about to turn 19 and this year has been awful ever since I graduated high school. I feel like an absolute failure as I'm not enrolled in college, I keep procrastinating on FAFSA, most of my family left to another state, and I have no friends to talk to. I can't help but feel like I'm in a constant state of dread and that dread only gets worse whenever I have to go in to work. I almost called out tonight just because I couldn't stand the thought of it. My anxiety gets so bad before I go in, but usually when I'm actually there it isn't so bad. 

Every day though, I feel myself slip into an even worse place than I was before. I don't want to feel like this anymore, and I don't want to be like this anymore. I used to be so much more ambitious and motivated but now I just feel like nothing matters. In my head I know that I have family that loves me and I have a boyfriend who I love more than anything but I feel so alone. At the same time, I just want to isolate myself. My thoughts only ever circulate around suicide and self harm (never done but I have considered), sometimes I'll forget why I even felt that way but then I'll remember on nights like this when everything feels so hopeless. I hate myself so much, I just don't want to anymore. I just want it to stop. I want to feel better. 

So, I've decided I want to start actively getting better. I work part-time but if I save every month I should be able to meet with a therapist to talk through my issues. I don't think it will fix my issues, but put me on a path to getting better. I'm scared it won't work and I won't know what to do if it doesn't. I don't know what else I can do to start getting better besides get into therapy. 

I have a lot of bad habits, like I smoke weed to feel better, I am constantly on my phone as a distraction, I don't exercise because I just don't enjoy it, I don't eat because I don't have the appetite, and when I do eat I will usually just eat one large meal for that day. I know these are habits that need fixed but I don't know how to stop any of them. It's just so much easier to be like that. But I'm also tired of being like that. 

All I want is to be happy. I just want to feel like how I did when I was in high school, where I had friends and was hopeful about the future, where I had a set schedule and time off to enjoy what I actually liked doing.

,depression_help,"I read it somewhere ....it helped me..hope helps you too

You will be alone most of the time. Not lonely, but alone. Try to understand the difference to avoid unnecessary suffering.

Happiness will not come easily as it came when you were young. You would have to work towards it. Discipline and sacrifice would be your best bet. Don't get caught in the YOLO gimmick.

Life will get boring. Your mind will wander. Learn to control it before it starts controlling you.

Your best friend might no longer be your best friend. Your ex would have already moved on. You will struggle. But it will imbue you with lots of wisdom. So don't curse yourself.

You'll realise in retrospect that very few people really loved you whilst others just wanted something out of you.

Memories are not always good. More than often, they induce unncecesary fear, anxiety and mood swings.

Time starts becoming the most valuable commodity. It will treat you like shit if you treat it cheaply.

Whether you like it or not, people will talk behind you. Sometimes it would be the people whom you trusted the most. Learn to ignore them.

You'll run down the guilt-valley more often than before. You will do things which you know is not good for you but will anyways end up doing it. You will invariably be distracted by foul things. This is your mind conquering your weak spot. Like I said, discipline can save you.

You'll realize that success is not that easy after all. It's that difficult. You would be tempted to give up on your dreams and live an average life. Don't.

Things will go wrong. Personally and professionally. The unexpected will happen. There won't be any reason/person to blame on. Your faith in humanity will plummet all of a sudden. But hey, don't give up. Move on.

You will soon start noticing your parents are getting old, your best friend is suffering from illness or money constrait. You realize how much time you've wasted playing the ego game. So don't wait. Make that phone call now.

Most of the times, you'll experience fear for no reason. When things are going good, you'll dread on ‘what if this happiness goes away?’. When things are not going good, you'll still dread on what's going to happen next.

You'll get your heart broken multiple times. And you'll have to break a couple of hearts yourself. That's life. There no right and wrong here.

There are no good people/bad people. You'll have to come out of this cynical mind-set. There are only people who bring you pleasantness and unplesantness. Remember, people who bring unplesantness to you might bring pleasantness to someone else.

You'll realize that multi-tasking is not beneficial. You start focusing on one big goal/day rather than 10 small goals/day. You'll learn to differentiate between being productive and being busy.

You'll learn that not all emotions you experience are genuine. More than half of them are mere mind-games. Learn to distinguish to avoid bouts of depression.

You'll be forced to change your attitude towards failures because you'll have more failures than success. You will no longer react to events, but will eventually respond to it. Reacting will get you into more trouble. Responding will move you towards a solution.

You'll realise that you can't be friends with everyone. And you don't have to be. Accept this fact sooner than later.

You'll realise that earning respect is more difficult than earning money. And it's the respect that would eventually make you feel proud about yourself in life.",t2_532l8epe,False,,0,False,Things likely to happening life,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'PROVIDING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_efqkd1,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},PROVIDING ADVICE,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1577362115.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read it somewhere ....it helped me..hope helps you too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be alone most of the time. Not lonely, but alone. Try to understand the difference to avoid unnecessary suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness will not come easily as it came when you were young. You would have to work towards it. Discipline and sacrifice would be your best bet. Don&amp;#39;t get caught in the YOLO gimmick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life will get boring. Your mind will wander. Learn to control it before it starts controlling you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your best friend might no longer be your best friend. Your ex would have already moved on. You will struggle. But it will imbue you with lots of wisdom. So don&amp;#39;t curse yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll realise in retrospect that very few people really loved you whilst others just wanted something out of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memories are not always good. More than often, they induce unncecesary fear, anxiety and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time starts becoming the most valuable commodity. It will treat you like shit if you treat it cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you like it or not, people will talk behind you. Sometimes it would be the people whom you trusted the most. Learn to ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll run down the guilt-valley more often than before. You will do things which you know is not good for you but will anyways end up doing it. You will invariably be distracted by foul things. This is your mind conquering your weak spot. Like I said, discipline can save you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll realize that success is not that easy after all. It&amp;#39;s that difficult. You would be tempted to give up on your dreams and live an average life. Don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things will go wrong. Personally and professionally. The unexpected will happen. There won&amp;#39;t be any reason/person to blame on. Your faith in humanity will plummet all of a sudden. But hey, don&amp;#39;t give up. Move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will soon start noticing your parents are getting old, your best friend is suffering from illness or money constrait. You realize how much time you&amp;#39;ve wasted playing the ego game. So don&amp;#39;t wait. Make that phone call now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the times, you&amp;#39;ll experience fear for no reason. When things are going good, you&amp;#39;ll dread on ‘what if this happiness goes away?’. When things are not going good, you&amp;#39;ll still dread on what&amp;#39;s going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll get your heart broken multiple times. And you&amp;#39;ll have to break a couple of hearts yourself. That&amp;#39;s life. There no right and wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no good people/bad people. You&amp;#39;ll have to come out of this cynical mind-set. There are only people who bring you pleasantness and unplesantness. Remember, people who bring unplesantness to you might bring pleasantness to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll realize that multi-tasking is not beneficial. You start focusing on one big goal/day rather than 10 small goals/day. You&amp;#39;ll learn to differentiate between being productive and being busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll learn that not all emotions you experience are genuine. More than half of them are mere mind-games. Learn to distinguish to avoid bouts of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll be forced to change your attitude towards failures because you&amp;#39;ll have more failures than success. You will no longer react to events, but will eventually respond to it. Reacting will get you into more trouble. Responding will move you towards a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll realise that you can&amp;#39;t be friends with everyone. And you don&amp;#39;t have to be. Accept this fact sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll realise that earning respect is more difficult than earning money. And it&amp;#39;s the respect that would eventually make you feel proud about yourself in life.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Mom backed out on our Christmas plans. This has been a pattern lately. She has been battling depression for basically as long as I can remember but it has taken a big toll on her as she’s gotten older. My husband and I (32F) were very happy to have my parents move back to town so they could spend time with us and our son (9yo). But my mom backs out of plans 90% of the time by saying “I’m not feeling well today.”

At first I was fine. I’ve battled with anxiety and depression for a while too so I could see similar patterns to my own and I understood. But now my son asks why she doesn’t pick him up from school anymore or come visit on the weekends. My husband gets frustrated when we cook dinners and they decide last minute not to come over. Etc etc. it’s affecting the whole family. 

Today (Christmas Day) was a breaking point for me. My mom texted me around 11am and said she wasn’t feeling well. I told her she should come over for our planned meal and that seeing us might make her feel better (she and my dad frequently tell me that when she talks to me or sees me it really lifts her spirits). Then two hours later she calls me and says she is not coming over. My dad stopped by and dropped off our presents and was crying because he is so beside himself. He has no idea what to do. 

My mom has sought out medical help. She has seen counselors and psychiatrists. She has tried different medicines throughout the years. It is not a lack of her wanting or trying to be better. She has even told me “I am so tired of being depressed. I am ready to feel better. “

My big problem is that I am letting it affect my mental health. I have spent a good chunk of Christmas Day crying. My anxiety has been a lot worse and I have been having more frequent panic attacks. I need help dealing with my feelings about my mom’s feelings and how it’s affecting our family dynamic. Help?

,depression_help,"I'm cynical and nihilist. Also I cry to make me fall asleep. I said to my mom that I hate being alive because every second of my existence makes me feel literally pain, except when I'm very high. So she got me a doctor appointment.

For the generalist doctor it was obviously a depression. He sent me to a therapist and he said I have severe depression and generalized anxiety.

Fuck that, I know I don't deserve happiness because Allah decided so and he is a real cunt. Fuck you Allah, I will never make again the mistake to pray a sexist, racist and egocentric bitch like you. I don't need to be happy. Yes I'm weak, but I'm stronger than my pain. I WILL live in that pain my entire life and work so the people who are able to feel happiness will have a great life. 

I will wait for the blessed day of my death but not fucking suicide and make my relatives sad.
I don't even want to write this. But I'm doing it so people stop lamenting on their live when I live in a constant suffer but don't kill myself even if death is the only thing that can fix my pain because I want to bring something to society.

Conclusion : If you are depressed, stop asking for happiness. You will never get happiness because God hates you. But we live in a society and you gotta make that society better. If you want to die but have no friends and family, give your body to science. You will work for the good of the humanity, stop been egoist. And stop showing everyone you are depressed stupid emos, life sucks for EVERYBODY. 

Now, go to work and don't worry : you are going to die.

So she got me a doctor appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the generalist doctor it was obviously a depression. He sent me to a therapist and he said I have severe depression and generalized anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck that, I know I don&amp;#39;t deserve happiness because Allah decided so and he is a real cunt. Fuck you Allah, I will never make again the mistake to pray a sexist, racist and egocentric bitch like you. I don&amp;#39;t need to be happy. Yes I&amp;#39;m weak, but I&amp;#39;m stronger than my pain. I WILL live in that pain my entire life and work so the people who are able to feel happiness will have a great life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will wait for the blessed day of my death but not fucking suicide and make my relatives sad.
I don&amp;#39;t even want to write this. But I&amp;#39;m doing it so people stop lamenting on their live when I live in a constant suffer but don&amp;#39;t kill myself even if death is the only thing that can fix my pain because I want to bring something to society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion : If you are depressed, stop asking for happiness. You will never get happiness because God hates you. But we live in a society and you gotta make that society better. If you want to die but have no friends and family, give your body to science. You will work for the good of the humanity, stop been egoist. And stop showing everyone you are depressed stupid emos, life sucks for EVERYBODY. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go to work and don&amp;#39;t worry : you are going to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS : Sorry if nothing makes sens I&amp;#39;m high on ambien. I hope you understand my message anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Reddit

I've lurked on Reddit for a long time, but with it being Xmas eve there is a story I felt I needed to share with you all.

I met my (F39) fiance when I was 25, he (M34) was just 19 at the time. He was both mature and hardworking, not like a normal 19 year old at all. Yet, at the same time, he was very fun, impulsive, and really good natured.

He'd help anyone, make a joke (in a good way) of even the worst situations, and was just a really positive and outgoing person.

Fast forward a few years, things are all still good and we just had out first (of 3) kids.

I was unable to work due to a) just having had a child, and b) I suffer from a chronic condition (CPRS) which was really bad at the time preventing me from working.

To make ends meet, he dropped his boxing hobby down to just 1 session a fortnight and was working both a full time and part time job. He was averaging about 70+hrs at work each week, and spent the rest of his time helping with the housework I couldn't do (due to my CPRS) and taking us out on family outings to the park, the woods, etc. Anything that didn't cost a lot.

He became naturally less like his old joyful helpful self, he became quite grouchy and irritable.

I put this down to his tiredness (Early starts for his full time job, late finishes for his part time job) and the fact he was effectively working all the time.

This continued to worsen, I know a lot of his friends blamed me, some of my family even blamed me. He got angrier and angrier. He had horrible uncontrollable thoughts of violence and suicide which only stressed him out further.

He would loose his temper more and more around the house at the smallest of things.

Whilst he was never violent towards any of us, he would shout a lot, hit the walls occasionally when things were bad. He became more confrontational with other people. Often they had done something wrong, but something that was ignore-able, like not holding a door, or something silly like that. He'd always call them on it.

He ended up getting into a few fights, lost his job as a doorman as a result and then ended up getting another part time job which was closer to a full time job. He was working almost 90 hours each week, probably sleeping less than 4 hrs a week.

With the support of his mother, we persuaded him to go to the doctors. Over the years he's been seen by various mental health teams and been diagnosed and misdiagnosed and again re-diagnosed with everything from depression, BPD, OCD, PTSD and even briefly ADHD. Our bathroom cabinet spent years looking like a pharmacy with all manner of different antidepressants, etc. Some made it a little better, but nothing really helped. They would increase doses, but by the time he actually got any real affect from them, the negative side effects were so bad the quality of life just wasn't there.

We struggled with this for a further 10 years, we even split a few times, but through it all I knew his old good natured self was still in there somewhere so I kept getting back with him and tried and tried to support him.

Now, here is the unusual twist. Shortly before our first child was born, he had a boxing injury which resulted in several lost/damaged teeth.

Due to our financial situation, he neglected dental care and suffered as we simple couldn't afford it. Even on the NHS price bands, the work was top tier, and that £150+ was a fortune to us.

He therefore suffered with awful teeth for roughly 15 years. The pain made it hard to brush them so others got bad, it got worse and worse.

The last few years out finances were better, and as a result I had a small savings pot. His Mum had a small lottery win, and we agreed to join some money together and we got him a treatment plan with a local private dentist who had a really really good reputation.

We gave this as a XMAS present for him.

He said we shouldn't have but we could tell he was really grateful for it.

He had all the treatment completed over a couple of months. By April it was all finished.

THIS was it. He was mid way through the treatment and he just changed. He very quickly became his old self again.

The dentist told me there are studies that suggest gum disease and mental health conditions can be linked, but he doesn't know for certain. Without saying anything confidential, he did comment that a lot of patients with poor teeth are often on antidepressants though.

Almost a year on, things are amazing. He's fully like he used to be, happy, joyful, helpful. He still works two jobs (although not to the same extent, 60hrs a week.) but he's in a great mood, even when he's tired.

He stopped his antidepressants back in July and that only seemed to improve things further.

For over a decade and half, we wasted time with doctors, meds, specialists etc, when the real cause was simply poor oral health.

I share this hoping that it is helpful to anyone else who may be suffering a similar fate and never put the two together.

&lt;p&gt;For over a decade and half, we wasted time with doctors, meds, specialists etc, when the real cause was simply poor oral health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share this hoping that it is helpful to anyone else who may be suffering a similar fate and never put the two together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL,DR: My fiance developed really severe depression and anger issues, was diagnosed all sorts of &amp;#39;conditions&amp;#39; but it turned out it was all caused by a poor oral health.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hello Reddit, 

I don't know if anyone is going to read this, and I don't even know what I hope to accomplish by it. I just know that I've made a complete waste of my life.

 I am a complete fraud, and no one has any clue about it. I live a lie, every single day. I lie to my family, and to every single one of my friends no matter how close I hold them to my heart. It's like what they see of me is a mask, and they wouldn't look at me the same if they knew my true face. I don't lie to hurt them, I lie out of complete shame in who I am and what I've succumbed to. And I know that I don't have it in my heart to reveal this because they would see me as lesser and completely broken compared to what they think I am. I've never told a single person, and just need to get it off my chest. So here I am to confess. 

Let me preface this by saying I have been dealt a more than fair hand in life. Financially upper middle class, went to private school in high school. I'm not crazy wealthy but I go to college with tuition and rent paid for, and a spending allowance that's pretty much level with most of my peers. I really don't want this to come off as arrogant, especially given what I am going to tell you later, but I would say I'm naturally very intelligent and can hang with almost everyone I’ve ever met on a purely intellectual level. Enough that I put up a minimum level of effort in high school and still got good enough grades and great test scores for me to get into great universities, and I go to one now. Socially speaking I was fairly popular growing up and never had to struggle for friends, I had a pretty big social circle in high school and still have one now in university. I’m pretty tall/athletic and decent in terms of attractiveness, enough that I don’t have much trouble finding girls who are attracted to me.

 Right now this all may sound to you like I’m some narcissist and just gassing myself up as a great/fulfilled guy in all aspects of life. But the truth is I’m not. I’ve wasted every single one of those advantages I had been dealt, completely. 

Before college I was lazy and undisciplined, but the pressure from my parents and the environment of working/collaborating alongside my peers held me accountable enough to get good grades in high school. In college, I slipped off completely. Parents were too far and too uninvolved at this point for me to feel any pressure from them. I wasn’t studying the same major or classes as my friends so didn’t keep myself accountable within any “group”. Professors don’t hold your hand either, just list out their expectations and don’t force you to come to class. This screwed me completely, due to my own internal lack of discipline and motivation. I started smoking weed all the time, and even long after my friends quit smoking I still smoke almost every day secretly because I can’t sleep without it. I sleep in all the time, skipped most of my classes. At the end of each semester I’d become panic stricken at how horribly I’d done, how many assignments I straight up didn’t do, how many tests I blew off studying for till the last second (combined with never going to class, so teaching myself everything at the last second). However, I’d somehow rationalize that I’d do better next time, calm down my panic, and then rinse and repeat the next semester. 

This has gone on pretty much every single semester (I am now in my 3rd year). My GPA is now sitting at a 2.31. I have failed multiple classes, gotten D’s and C’s all the time and used up every academic Q drop I have. I have literally photoshopped and edited my grade reports when it comes to showing my parents, and put falsified grades on my resumé as part of the façade that I am capable of applying for and getting internships. I sent out applications with that false information on my resume knowing I would never follow up, just to keep the ruse up for my parents/friends. I’ve lied to them for 2 summers in a row claiming I was doing research or in an unpaid internship, knowing I wouldn’t have gotten any of those if I actually applied. I have no clue what I am going to do once I graduate. I’ve told people I’m gonna try for grad school but inside I know that is a complete joke because there is no chance in hell I could ever get into grad school with my grades. I wouldn’t get a job anywhere either, at least any job that is at the level that is expected of someone from my university/major. 

Socially, like I said I have no problem when it comes to friends. I have no problems finding girls to like me either, but I am emotionally dysfunctional and can’t seem to develop real attachment to any of the girls I tried to date, only for 1 girl I had fallen head over heels for as soon as I met her and she has a boyfriend. I’ve had sex twice in my life, for all the chances and advantages I had in this regard.

 To put it short, I am pretty much a fraud and a failure in every single aspect of my life. I’m the meme of “smart but lazy kid” on steroids to the point that I completely destroyed my chances of success, all the ‘good’ that my intellect did me. And I have absolutely NO ONE and NOTHING to blame except myself. I’ve had deep seated depression for years. I consider happiness to not be a momentary state of mind, but rather a state of life. And I have not been happy with my life whatsoever since I left for college. Something deeply dysfunctional inside of me has made me incapable of stepping up and putting my foot forward when it comes to adulthood. I had all the necessary advantages and capabilities except for the capability to “just do it, and keep doing it”. I failed. 

And the sad part is, growing up I had always wished so much more for myself. I was always super curious growing up, reading books and binging science/tech Youtube channels like Isaac Arthur (which I recommend to anyone who reads this). I always dreamed of not just getting by and getting a good job, but excelling and pushing my way to the forefront of my field. Discovering or creating something that was truly important, leaving a real mark on the world. I am a huge believer in what humanity can accomplish, even in the near future, and I always wanted to count myself amongst that. Unfortunately I had too high hopes for myself.

Please feel free to add your own suggestions, these are the ones that came to mind for me. 

1. Don't tell us what we're capable of doing or have the potential to do. We're already doing our best. 
2. Providing love and support for us where we're at is the secret to getting us to function better, but sometimes even support doesn't counteract a really hard day. Be okay with this. 
3. Stop giving us advice on how to become less depressed unless we ask for it specifically. See #2. 
4. Before you say that we are perpetuating our own bad situations, remember that you are missing several factors that create a person with depression: environment, income, home life, schooling, abuse factors, etc. 
5. If you are involved in a power dynamic-oriented relationship with us (parents, bosses, etc.), you are the last person that should be pushing boundaries or forcing us to ""go outside"". But you are the first person who should be ensuring that you aren't pushing us too hard. 
6. People who don't want to take pills are not making excuses. Concerns about SSRIs are not unfounded, and it's up to us to weigh the risks and benefits with their doctor/psychiatrist. 
7. We're not always sad. Sometimes we're angry. Sometimes we're numb. Sometimes we seem completely cheerful and normal and hide all of our symptoms as best we can. 
8. Sometimes we *do* make it much worse with our own downward spirals and negative inner-talk. Telling us this does nothing to solve that problem. Refer to #2. 
9. Therapists - get extra rest. Take care of yourself. Do not take on too many patients. Be sure that this is what you really want to do, because people are counting on you to truly care. Be careful how you talk about people's mental health situations, because your compassion fatigue can and will rear its ugly head. 
10. If you're sick of us whining about our problems, it means you need a break from whatever is stressing you out and shouldn't be trying to support anyone's depression. Take a vacation. Go on a date. Focus on yourself. 
11. If you're close to us, ask if you can do specific things to help (if you want to). Offer to make food, clean up, or run errands on a bad day. Maybe all we need is someone to sit next to or a hug. Maybe we need some time alone. Maybe we finally need a ride to a counselor's office or hospital. Ask. 
12. Don't support us in the hopes that your efforts will ""fix"" our depression. It's something you have to be willing to accept without expectations of anything changing. We may beat depression, but some of us take longer or will continue to struggle with it our whole lives - if this makes you uncomfortable, that sounds like a you problem.",t2_5a6y4ly0,False,,0,False,How to coexist with depressed people (by someone with chronic depression),"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'PROVIDING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_eeyh7o,False,dark,,public,57,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},PROVIDING ADVICE,False,57,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_1': 1},,True,,1577203903.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a throwaway?

i have been suffering from depression for more than five years now - it is managed so far. i tried some medications, currently on cymbalta 60, and generally i am all right. some days are worse than others, but i think i learn how to cope with it. what i have been experiencing for the last couple of days, though, is new for me, and i don't know what to do.

,depression_help,"The TLDR of it is my little brother needs the car that I use, instead of the car he has been using. I don't know if I should let him take it.

After finishing college last May I have done nothing. I didn't learn anything at school, and have no marketable skills. I'm not even clever or hardworking. Recognizing this, I quickly gave up looking for a job. Why would anyone hire me if I'm objectively the worst choice? I figured that I was going to kill myself within the year and didn't want to waste time. My parents don't know what to do with me and I don't blame them, I don't know what to do with myself.

My little brother goes to school and needs a car. My parents are well off and were able to provide a rear wheel drive sedan, originally for my older brother, that he could use. During my senior year of college I was able to take the family Jeep to school with me. I've always loved this car more than life itself so while having it under my direct care was a lot of stress, I preferred it to having it anywhere else. This is the car my little brother has been lobbying for since before he left for school.

He goes to school in Montana and claims that the city he lives in doesn't bother with plowing the roads, making travel for him difficult. According to a website on the city's snow plowing schedule he shouldn't have trouble driving to and from class regardless of how many wheel drive he has. My parents have issued me an ultimatum, that if I don't start looking for a job again, they will let him take the Jeep back to school.

I don't want the Jeep taken away from me, but I especially don't want it with my little brother. He's reckless, arrogant, a know it all and wants desperately to take the car off roading. I'm no expert on the subject but I know it is going to break the car. My little brother is going to try to fix it himself and knowing him he is either going to fix it improperly or not at all, causing further damage.

Looking for a job isn't an issue for me, I can waste my time, fine. But I'm questioning if my little brother should be allowed to take the Jeep. Maybe he's lying about the roads, maybe he's telling the truth. My parents have told me that he is going to need an off road vehicle and if he doesn't take the Jeep, they claim to have money set aside to buy him a car for out there. I live with my parents in suburbia, there's no good reason for me to drive the Jeep, it's big and takes a lot of gas. In my current state I leave the house once, maybe twice a week. My parents are looking to retire some day, and even though they ""have money set aside"" wouldn't it be better if they didn't have to spend it on another car and could potentially retire a little earlier? Aren't I being selfish for considering keeping the Jeep here and forcing them to spend this money on top of the increased financial burden of me living at home?

I used to be a smart kid despite dyslexia, it took me a while to get the hang of reading and writing, but once I got it, I enjoyed it a lot. My father was an alcoholic and he would beat me to within an inch of life daily, so books and fantasy became my haven. I'm not trying to justify his actions, but I can't really blame him that much. My parents, they didn't want a son and once my mom got pregnant, they discovered she had a heart condition. She would spend the next 15 years in hospitals having surgery after surgery. I guess my dad didn't take it very well, they were a young couple in financial difficulties, then a newborn and such a serious medical condition, I'm sure this is likely to disturb anyone...  


Fast forward some 17 years, I had finished high-school and all I wanted was to move out and not to get beaten every day. I still had a lot of anger inside of me, I was young and dumb. I pretty much never had a clear goal in my life so far. My friends used to talk about how they dreamed to become doctors, dentists, veterinarians and such, while all I ever wanted was to survive. Not sure if this is what really cause my complete lack of ambition or if I was already broken...  


During high-school I saved some money while going through lot of different odd jobs  and such. When I finally graduated I moved to the state's capital by myself. Some 200 miles away from my hometown that place was somewhat scary. My hometown had some 60,000 inhabitants and suddenly I was living in this metropolis surrounded by 12,000,000 people, it was a rush, I quickly found a place to stay and in less than a week I had a job. Not bad, I though to myself...

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't take long for me to meet a girl. She was a sweet little thing, we fell in love like the two dumb teenagers we were. She was a little older than me and she had a son already. A couple of months later I rented a house and she and her son moved in with me, we adopted some cats and we had a little garden. Those I think were the best months of my life. But good things don't seem to last and the company I was working for ended up going under and like that I saw myself staring at my over due bills...

&amp;#x200B;

Things were going real bad as I couldn't find another job and the money was running out. If I was alone, I probably could've pulled through, but now I had them to take care of, so I ended up joining the Marines so I could support them. I never saw myself as a military man until that, but we gotta do what we gotta do.  


I rather not to go in details about my service, except for the fact I spent four years deployed. It was around that time I first felt I was losing control over this darkness inside of me. In my last six months I couldn't even call her. I kept sending the checks, but I just couldn't bear talking to her... I had this weight upon my shoulders, I felt ashamed and dirty... I didn't even tell her when I came back, I just showed up at the front yard... I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't bring myself to knock on the door. It was raining as I stood there for some time, not sure how long, eventually the neighbors called the cops and she went out when they arrived...  


I remember feeling terrible as she hugged me and cried. I felt awkward and scared, not sure why, I just didn't feel at home. It felt like I was trying to fit into someone else's life... That's when the nightmares begun. They kept her up all night, it was horrible and eventually I moved out of the house... I told her I would keep paying the bills for them, but she just left...  


That's when I got into drinking. I spent two years drenched in alcohol until one day I had a cardiac arrest due to alcohol poisoning... I tried to kill myself three times before that, but I ended up quitting because I was only hurting whoever still cared a little bit for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Things actually didn't get any better after I quit. To be completely honest, it all got a lot worse after... Fast forward some years and I'm here... I am 30 years old, I'm barely making through between long time unemployment and some odd jobs, I'm earning enough to pay the rent and feed my cats even though sometimes I don't have food for myself, not that it matters anyway as I barely have any appetite. I can't keep any relationships, be it friends or girlfriends, I'm always alone. My house is covered in trash as I just can't bring myself to clean anything and I can't remember the last time I had a bath.  


I'm writing this right now because I didn't get any sleep in the last four days and I just needed to share this with someone. I'm not even sure if I'll actually post it or just delete it after I finish writing it, like I already did many times before... I feel embarrassed and scared all the time. Every morning I close my windows in shame and I sneak around my own house in fear my neighbors would realize I'm here. Every little noise I hear gets my mind racing, thinking about the police storming into my house because someone might have complained about the smell... I just feel like a complete failure, an embarrassment, I feel like I threw my life away and I just can't come back from all my bad decisions, but at the same time I feel this sickening despair flooding my brain to do something now...  


I try to do my best for my cats... I keep their litter box clean and I always get them the most expensive food, but the rest is completely abandoned... I feel like people would commit me to an institution if anyone saw they way I've been living and even knowing that I just don't have the strength to do anything about it... Countless times I started to gather all the trash and cleaning the house just to collapse on the trash and lie there... Sometimes I even manage to, but then I feel too embarrassed to throw all that trash out and end up exposing myself like that...  


It's been some long years since I last tried to kill myself, but lately, I'm feeling like I'm getting cornered more and more each day. I feel like I don't have any other options and I really don't know if I'll get through this time... I just don't feel sad anymore, I can't cry, I can't eat or sleep...  


It's been half-an-hour since I finished typing this and I decided to post it... I'm very sorry if this made you feel sad in anyway, it was not my intention, but for some unknown reason I just needed to share it with someone. I'm very tired and broken and this may well be the last opportunity I have to share my story with someone and for some reason, I belive I deserve at least that.  


I also do it in the hope someone may find some comfort or understanding of what I went through and maybe use it for the betterment of one's life...

,depression_help,"I struggle with mental health no matter what I'm doing but it's manageable until I have to go to school every day. I've had this problem virtually ever since I started elementary school. I'm a freshman in college now. I noticed how bad it was one Monday after a three day weekend. I was feeling great from the little break and the second my feet hit the school grounds, all my anxiety, depression, and negativity his me like a truck.

I can find little things that make life bearable but I'm not really enjoying my time on Earth, especially if you tally up the good days compared to the bad. I have a great therapist but I can't see him that often and he's about to move away. I've lost almost all my friends since high school and haven't made a single real friend since college started. I have a supportive family but I don't have enough people behind me to face going to school anymore.

When I get really scared I shut down. My emotions all turn off and I don't feel anything. I'm getting really sad again but I haven't been able to cry in almost a year (with the exception of the first week of school). It feels nice because I know my brain is protecting me from all the pain I could really be feeling but that blissful ignorance is interrupted when school starts again and everything I've been ignoring comes out all at once. The next semester is starting, and I was so resistant to going back that my brain blocked out the fact that it started today. My brain literally made me forget that school was starting so I missed the first day. I really don't want to go. I can't seem to accept the fact that I'm going to have years more of this agonizing bullshit to go through.

I think anyone who's been through school understands why it sucks, so I don't need to waste time explaining all the reasons why I hate it. I hate being constrained by school or having a tight schedule or set of rules forced on me. But at the same time I struggle with worsening anxiety and I need a hand to hold to get through life on my own. I'm definitely not ready to go to a university or live alone yet. I would probably get suicidal again. I don't want to die but if I get scared enough, I'm worried what I'll do. I'm not going to do anything drastic, but I think about it a lot. I would really like to stop existing but there's a bunch of things I still want to do with my life, I'll worry about dying after that. The problem is, in order to achieve all my goals, I need to get through school. I'm really scared that life after school is still going to suck, if not be worse. I've survived years of serious depression, but after that was over and I got to be happy for a while, another rough patch came on ridiculously quickly. And that was when I was forced to go back to school.

What if life is just an unending cycle of struggles? I feel like I'm fighting to stay afloat, and once I get to breathe I can't enjoy it because I can see the next wave in the horizon.

she likes younger guys also said she wanted a relationship but the way she was acting kept making me believe she wanted sex, cause she sent me nudes without me asking on our 1st videocall she teased

relationship with her we needed to have sex a few times to see how I make her feel in bed and also go out with her a little more to public places to see how I would react when she begins to have a panic attack in public, but for some reason kept making me wait,on the very 1st dates she was telling me she suffered from panic attacks,anxiety,ocd and because of that depression.Also on the 1st 3 dates she was the one who invited me out and also the one who pay on the dates.The last one it was me.\n\nBut here is when things get weird, since we stopped texting she was barely entering the places were she use to chat with me, the main ones were whatsapp and snapchat I\'m talking about days without being online, she did watched my stories on snapchat from time to time,also everytime I sent her a picture of me on snapchat she would saved or a long message she would saved even after she ghosted me,she doesnt usually save our snapchat convos.When she does gets online is only very late at night and for a few minutes also most of the time not all the time but most when she text with me she always replied late at night like at 4 am.She blocked me from her phone number but not on all the other places were we chatted the most, we actually never text or call through phone number it was always on whatsapp.She doesnt have social media but 2 weeks after she stopped replying she made a private IG and posted some pics in which one of the pics it was a picture she sent me earlier when we 1st started texting were she is in her bed showing her ass and also put and adreess that it seems it looks like is her house.And that\'s very weird to me, also that IG that she made it looks like she doesnt enter there that much either.\n\nAnother thing most of the pictures that she post are old pictures and it looks like they are pictures taken from another phone like she took another phone to take a picture of the screen of the other phone were the picture is, weird I suggest.She is by far the weirdiest and most mysterious female I have dated.Another thing she lives with her parents and said she had 4 abortions, never been married and she doesnt wanna have kids cause that would make her anxiety worse.It looks like she likes to have sex a lot cause she talked about that a lot with me in dates.Doesnt have any friends male or female.Doesnt like kissing on the mouth even tho I made her do it.Now almost a month had pass since last time I sent her a message and I sent her a message on whatsapp days ago it was a picture saying Happy New Year but the reason I sent this it was to verify if she had me on her contacts cause I know a function on whatsapp to verify that.You sent a message through a group and if the person saw the message it means they have you on their contacts.\n\nShe saw it ignored it but reply like 7 hours later reply with a thank you,then I text her again saying if something happen to her and she said ""you know why I\'m like this, we already talk about this.I thought you understood me"" I know she was talking about her depression etc.She started replying to me again after ghosting me for a month.I told her I understood her but I did not undertand why she became distant with me in just 2 days and she said "" Im like that,I told you"" then I ask her are you bipolar and she said ""no, if you dont understand me then why keep talking"" I said I understand I just wanna know you more and she said doesnt look like it, now she is replying to me again but her answers are kind of cold like last time, leaves me on read sometimes but I text her again and she keeps replying and is not texting 1st but atleast she is replying but I dont know if I should believe her if that was really the reason why she ghosted me.I mean I believe her that she suffer from all that she showed me the pills she was taking for her mental illness and kept talking about it and she does have a lot signs of someone not mentally alright but I\'m not really sure.I have not invited her out yet now but I feel like she is gonna say no or leave me on read again or she might say yes I\'m not really sure. \n\nMy question is if she not interested,why she doesn\'t just tell me and that\'s it, I have told her if it is that she simply can just say it that is not gonna harm me at all is just gonna save me time but the last time I told her that she ignore that message,why replying to me after a month, why she keeps watching my stories, why she doesnt delete me from any other place or  keeping me in her phone number contacts?', 'author_fullname': 't2_5ansfsc0', 'saved': False,

let me know but left me on read.Little info she is 10 years older than me, Im 23 male,she said she likes younger guys also said she wanted a relationship but the way she was acting kept making me believe she wanted sex, cause she sent me nudes without me asking on our 1st videocall she teased me,on the dates she kept talking about sex,on the 3rd date she mention that she wanted to see my penis in flaccid state while I was in her car, another thing she said that in order to be in a relationship with her we needed to have sex a few times to see how I make her feel in bed and also go out with her a little more to public places to see how I would react when she begins to have a panic attack in public, but for some reason kept making me wait,on the very 1st dates she was telling me she suffered from panic attacks,anxiety,ocd and because of that depression.Also on the 1st 3 dates she was the one who invited me out and also the one who pay on the dates.The last one it was

,depression_help,"Tl;dr: I live with my parents and don't have a proper job because of mental health problems. My friends are doing great and they have good jobs, own homes etc. I shouldn't feel inadequate but I do, I feel ashamed. 

I'm 31 and I live with my parents and do some work part time but I don't earn anywhere near enough to afford to live indepently.

I had a difficult time at school because I was bullied a lot and found it hard to make friends. I went to uni when I was 18 and again I struggled to make friends at first but in my final year I finally felt included by a good group of friends for the first time in my life.

I had problems with depression through my teenage years and anxiety from childhood. At uni my anxiety got a whole lot worse. When I was 21 and graduated, I moved back home, where my parents pressured me into doing an internship straight away even though I was ill. I burned out and had my first complete mental breakdown. After that, it became a cycle of short term jobs and breakdowns. I managed to live independently for over 2 years but then I had to move back in with my parents for practical and financial reasons. They're retired and my mum is disabled so they value having me around to help, even though they can be quite critical of me at times. 

In the past few years I've done some temporary jobs and right now I have some work I can do from home and some self employed work. My mental health is much more stable but I'm earning less than half of what I earned working full time as I work less than 20 hours most weeks. But as I'm living with my parents I've got enough money for the things I want to do. 

In my home town most of the people I know I've met through mental health services and most of them don't work, so I don't feel weird about not having a proper job. 

I still see some of the friends I made at uni but I find it difficult because they all earn a lot more than me and they've got their own homes. I feel like I've got stuck where they were 9-10 years ago.  When we meet up they talk about stuff like bills, appliances and interior design. I'm still sleeping in the same room I've had since I was 10, which is a mess because I've got more stuff than I can fit in one room. 

I feel like when I used to play Mario Kart Wii with my friends at uni and I was really bad at it at first, so I'd end up driving the wrong way and getting lapped. I feel like I've been lapped and I'm watching my friends move further and further ahead of me. 

I know the theory about not comparing myself to others and I know they will be struggling under the surface with life too. But I can't shake the feelings of shame at my situation when I'm with my friends and it makes me almost not want to see them. I feel ashamed telling new people that I live with my parents, too.

,depression_help,"So I recently realised that I may have been abused as a child. I'm currently attending uni and decided to just use the resources it provides. Long story short, I met with a professional and was very quickly diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) due to unpleasantly intrusive thoughts/memories and avoidance of objects that remind me of the abuse (My mum always wore heavy boots and carried a large key ring. I can vividly imagine the sound of her angry footsteps and her jingling keys, and both put me on edge so much so that I can't carry keys on a ring or wear clothing/footwear similar to hers). The reasons behind the diagnosis aren't of critical importance though.

I'm not sure what I expected from the diagnosis. Relief? Comfort? Justification? I honestly can't say for sure. Part of me thought it would somehow make things better in that it would provide some sort of justification for my feelings, some name and definition with a definitive course of action. Part of me thought it would finally prove that I do indeed feel the way I claim to, since some of my mates accuse me of lying, fabricating, or exaggerating what I try to describe.

Obvious throwaway.  
Not attention seeking but more seeking advice....

All I have been thinking about the past 2 weeks.  
I'm currently 16.  
I'm very introverted and shy with almost no social skills. I stay away from everyone. Getting bullied all the time.  
That's why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC's being an escape from that.  
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.  
On top of that I have realized I'm 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I've never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?  
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.  
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?  
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.  
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.  
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.  
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.  
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?  
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.

,depression_help,"(Cw suicide mention and self harm) 

My depression was out of control the last 3 weeks. It comes in cycles and I may not have the proper diagnosis. 

This time it was so bad that 3 weeks ago I put a lighter to my arm in places until I couldn't anymore. I'd had a panic attack and could not calm down despite my prescription Klonopin. 

Thursday night, I wanted to do this again before I healed and got an unexpected call from my mother. We don't talk much about my mental health, but we live 2 hours away, so we see each other a lot, so she sees my cycles of highs and lows. I was sobbing and word vomited about my constant suicidal ideation eating at my brain. I am always aware the thoughts are irrational, but they are overwhelming. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this coming Monday, but we agreed to meet halfway at a good hospital the next morning. Screw work, I need to get my head on straight! I begged her to let me sleep in since I'd been sleep deprived for weeks and she agreed that I would call her in the morning. We made plans for me to come stay at home for a while so I can get better. I've been battling this since I was 7 years old, and I am 23 now! I want to be happy, so I thought ""Hell yeah! Let's get my brain working right this time!""

I woke up at 7:30ish AM to banging on the door. My roommate's boyfriend assumed it was our annoying neighbor. Banging again. I put on some sweatpants and look in the peep hole and it's the police! ""Are you Casey xXxX?"" they ask. My heart sank. I tell them to come on inside and they explained they had a distress call. I let them into my bedroom and look at my phone to see so many missed calls from my worried mother. While they were in my room, I call her and say ""WHY DID YOU CALL THE POLICE?!"" but she was sobbing and scared and worried for me. 

I had to cooperate and let them take me through a back entrance to some emergency room type deal to be mentally evaluated. I thanked them for my first ride in a cop car. I got temporarily locked in a room where I called and broke up with my absolutely unsupportive boyfriend. I let a few close friends know what was up. 

After a mental evaluation, I was thrown in a taxi with no idea where I was going. I had to ask a staff member 3 times where I would be so my parents (who were high tailing it to see me) could know where I was going. I get dropped off with no clue where to go in this dirty rehab facility. The staff were rude and the amazing cleaning staffwoman helped me find where to go and comforted me more than any counselor. 

I went inside to see what the deal about being admitted was. More rules than a prison. No personal belongings - not even my music. I didn't have my books with me or any belongings. Forced group therapy (I HATE GROUP THERAPY). I refused and got an attitude from the staff lady. I walked into the lobby and just cried and waited on my parents to take me home. A doctor of sorts gave me a juice to take my medicine since I hadn't eaten or drank all day and it was almost 1 PM at this point. 

When my parents finally arrived, we got ahold of a place who will do inpatient-outpatient care! We went to pack a bag for me, and my roommate is lovingly taking care of my cat. I start Monday. Alongside psychiatry, I hope they have some kind of therapy that isn't the norm. I will chat for a bit, but I've dreamt of art or music therapy. I want to create. I cook to calm my soul. I can't be locked in a room like the woman from the Yellow Wallpaper. It's not for me. 

So wish me luck as I start a new and different journey of intense treatment. My parents are being very helpful and supportive. My mom was extremely apologetic about the police. Living with them is very stressful and we are setting major boundaries. I'm going to move back to my hometown in my own little place once I am feeling better and can get a job where I excel (I've been job hopping badly through these cycles). I might be able to finish up my degree at the local tech school, too! I've also given up alcohol until March or April - I don't have a drinking problem, just not allowing anything to make things worse. Only healthy foods and yoga every day is happening. I feel very hopeful. I still have that voice tugging at me and crying spells, but it's going to get better. I am going to get better!!!!!!!

Any advice about how to deal with therapy (I really hated CBT and group therapy) would be great. I've only ever been to a psychiatrist and a few therapy/counseling sessions for the last 3 years. Or, I'd also love advice on the situation in general.

&lt;p&gt;My depression was out of control the last 3 weeks. It comes in cycles and I may not have the proper diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it was so bad that 3 weeks ago I put a lighter to my arm in places until I couldn&amp;#39;t anymore. I&amp;#39;d had a panic attack and could not calm down despite my prescription Klonopin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday night, I wanted to do this again before I healed and got an unexpected call from my mother. We don&amp;#39;t talk much about my mental health, but we live 2 hours away, so we see each other a lot, so she sees my cycles of highs and lows. I was sobbing and word vomited about my constant suicidal ideation eating at my brain. I am always aware the thoughts are irrational, but they are overwhelming. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist this coming Monday, but we agreed to meet halfway at a good hospital the next morning. Screw work, I need to get my head on straight!

The subsidy in my country based on family approval and bureaucracy and my dad never applied it to me and decided to disappear. Last year I discovered that I was adopted by my parents.

It was hard to get a job and I was very poor. I barely ate food twice a week to save money. I could not get a good job (a decent salary, good working environment, stable contract) and keep got a scam job (job description different from the reality etc). Somehow without grades, jobs I got a job only in a hotel, cafe, bar, restaurant and those jobs sell body/appearance in my country. Office jobs always rejected me. I was very traumatic because the environment was really bad, I got harassment, promotion based on an affair with the boss or foreign shareholders, etc.

I decided to fix my life by savings for education but the university without subsidy is too much for me. And, in my country, I have a time limit for subsidy 2 years after high school and it was impossible for me to apply. Then, I enrolled in vocational college but still in the tourism industry. It was still hard for me to get a job even I graduate because the degree is not that popular. But I decided to take the master and abroad because there are many opportunities for scholarship abroad.

I got a partial scholarship so I need to contribute for flights, first settlement allowance etc. But, I don't expect if I live with low scholarship allowance in western Europe is very difficult

I thought life is similar to my country but in Europe money is needed more than in my country to be independent and not rely on other people. Students from my country mostly snobs here so they won't care about my difficult life. Work also very hard due to my resident permit. I had lots of debt for moving here. I got harassed and bullied by snobs students from my country. They also make a group based on social status. But to find local friends is very difficult. If I need help or something I need to pay. I am too stressed and my grades suck. I demotivated and committed suicide. Local people told me I should do sports and association. I am not used with sports and join clubs to get friends and be active (for me it just a waste of money). I am not used that I need to go to psychoa logist to talk (usually with friends). I am not used with spending money on happiness such as vacation etc. I also stressed out too many students focus on sex-oriented here, so that, finding a true friend is difficult.

People from my country told me the best way to get out of the problem is to marry someone. It is a culture that poor women need to marry but I don't want. On the other hand, I don't have an option. Even my embassy told me without family then no one would help you now. They advised me to have a family.

,depression_help,"I’ve been having a rough go of things.  I just discovered this subreddit, and thought it might be therapeutic to vent.  

Since November 23rd I’ve had a chronic sinus infection.  I’ve had numerous doctors visits and I take the full course of antibiotics, do the inhalers, do the ear drops, do the nose sprays, and I feel better for a bit, then I get worse when it comes back when I finish things and the cycle continues.  and me, being 26 with hardly any idea how the US health insurance system works, am now stuck with a $500 bill after insurance even though nothing works and feels defeating.  On top of that, my livers getting worse from drinking from being depressed.  More on that in a minute.  The upside to the sinus infection is I’ve stopped smoking and vaping for a month as of today.  I Smoked from 15-19 and from 23-26 and since I started back up, I’ve had no success as long as I have today.  So you’d think I’d be proud.  

However, I’ve been maniacally depressed since Christmas Eve.  I’ve cried myself to sleep every night since then.  Felt suicidal.  The whole 9 yards.  I’ve dealt with depression since a young age.  I’ve tried killing myself numerous times over my life, but it’s either failed, or I couldn’t follow through from fear.  So I constantly feel as though I’d be better off dead, but too cowardly to commit.  A big part of this is living at home.  

In 2015 I moved back home and dropped out of school due to a bad semester, two severe car accidents that make me fear driving in wintry weather, and numerous other things.  I consistently fight with my mother especially.  I WANT to move out.  But due to my financial setbacks that keep coming up, I cannot.  And I feel consistently defeated.  

My mother used to be my closer parent.  But as we’ve aged she’s no longer comforting.  But harsh.  I can’t remember the last time I saw her genuinely happy without faking it.  She claims she doesn’t have bipolar disorder, but I don’t know which mother I’ll get sometimes.  The normal one, or one where she’ll walk in screaming and targeting people.  I have bipolar disorder.  But I’m medicated for it.  As well as my depression.  My mother also will go out of her way to bring her negativity onto other family members.  She’s very unhappy.  She smokes pot at night and has an overeating disorder that makes me uncomfortable to see her that way because she’ll try to talk to me when I get off work and I can’t hold a conversation because she’s in a haze.  I no longer feel comfortable telling her my problems.  She either doesn’t listen, or is harsh about my concerns.  

My dad on the other hand refuses to let me speak when I try and tell him what’s wrong.  I’ll cry and try to explain why I’m upset, but he constantly interrupts after I ask him to stop, or he’ll blame it on me,  I try and ask him to let me finish why I’m upset, but he won’t listen.  And after a number of attempts I just stop talking and don’t say anything and he’ll try and “comfort” me but it feels hollow because I haven’t gotten my points out, and they just feel useless.   

I’ve recently tried reaching out to my middle brother (who my mother hates because he’s left the stoop and is married and has all kinds of ill will against him and his wife) and I don’t know who to believe about my little brother because part of me doesn’t believe my mom, part of me does.  He’s been supportive.  He’s all I’ve got right now to listen to me.  My youngest brother (I’m the oldest of 3) is 17 and I don’t think he’s mature enough to handle what I’m dealing with.  

I’m seriously at the end of my rope.  I feel I have no one to explain my depression to, to comfort me, or anything.  My family keeps pushing me further and further away.  My friends have expressed they’re fed up with me saying I’m depressed.  And I feel I have no other routes to take.  I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 28th but I don’t want to be put back on more meds.  He’s seen me my whole life.  And I need a counselor.  Or someone to talk to.  I just feel powerless.  Useless.  Like I’ll never break free and my family is pulling away from me.

,depression_help,"After almost a decade of therapy and meds, I’m officially “treatment resistant.” I don’t think I can keep going with how I feel but I don’t want to give up. So I’m looking for alternative treatments to typical psych drugs. 

I (21F) have depression (dysthymia, cyclical depression), anxiety (GAD, panic), OCD (with dermatillomania), and PTSD. 

I’m currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they don’t work. 

Some things I’ve tried: 

1. Dozens of prescribed meds: Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax (got addicted), Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc.

2. Therapy: talk, exposure, acceptance, etc.

,depression_help,"Hi, so I'm an amateur artist (like REALLY amateur), my art skills suck and despite trying for over a decade I can't seem to improve. Art has always been a passion of mine, as well as something I genuinely enjoy doing (on the extremely rare occasion that I manage to produce a slightly-less-s\*\*\*-than-usual drawing at least) so feeling like my art is stuck at the sub-deviantart level has made me incredibly frustrated and is probably the leading contributor to my depression. It's getting to the point that I'm beginning to wonder if I should force myself to avoid art in general just to keep the self-hatred at bay.

So some background, she and I have been together since July 2019, I've learned a few things that I had not  previously known before hand, like that she has anxiety and depression and she gave me an opportunity to  opt out of the relationship.

everything went relatively smoothly from there, can't think of any major scenarios but  then October 23rd she called me crying and saying she didn't want to live anymore and that there was no  reason for her to be here, kept  me up late  but I  was able  to calm her down enough and we both went to sleep,  and  she was still there in the morning,  a date I haven't forgotten, I was  on edge of different things after then but eventually  I thought things began to be handled.

January 12th turns out I was wrong.  same situation as before except  more  dire, there was a point where I almost had to call  her dad.  Her dad is aware  of the depression and later will be talked more about. I knew  that she would hate me if  I did but I  had really thought she was going to do it/doing it, I ended up  not having to as she called me after I had said that--I thought it was to break up with me honestly--I  was  able to  keep her  on the line and eventually we went to sleep and again she was there in the morning. Something I continue to pray for.

present time: It's exam  season, we're in  high school, everyone's stressed, which I know isn't helping, the night before the first exam she ignored me  after  I mentioned studying for her  exam.

Today was  our second exam (before  situation got worked out) after the exams we would  go to my  house and do whatever. We  both had a great time and  eventually  she had to leave, we're about a 45 minute drive apart now because she's moved to a different city, but stayed in school with all her friends ( and myself) so she had gone down to the bus station and they hadn't let her on the bus to get back to her city, so she called me crying, her dad went to pick her up.

Once she  arrives home, she hadn't texted me on the drive, which i found irregular but i  thought  she had just been stressed, then I get a message that says :

""You're going  to be mad at me""

so we get into that and she says that she jumped  out of the car while it was  moving, she tried reassuring me with the fact she said it  was slowing down but she said her dad refused to pull over when asked to, so  she did that...I let her explain everything  to me without much comment,  she said  she was okay, she called me and we talked about it there for a bit, she said she knew I was mad at her and could not deal with someone who would be mad at her as it  would increase anxiety.  She also  says I need to actually  do research on her conditions because it seems like I don't care, and proceeded to break up with me, happened before, I get  to  find out if it's real or not tomorrow. Was I mad? well  yes, honestly, I never voiced it but she said she heard it and that had stopped conversation. I hadn't been saying much as well i wasn't happy with what just happened, so the understandably so the silence that I  kept leaving also made it  seem like I was  more mad, there wasn't much conversation that I could  have  without  getting to mad, because the questions I had on my mind were things like ""What was going through your head"" and ""What were you thinking"" so i chose to be quiet instead, sadly its something I've had to do before.

&amp;#x200B;

I  just need some advice on this, she's gone to bed now, which i think is  a good idea, but I need  someone  to help me understand, or send  links for me to help me. I do what I can when we're together to keep her happy but when she  goes  home it's hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Another  note that might be relevant  is she's talking  to  her ex boyfriend again,  not that  I really  think to much of it but today she was trying to  hide that she had been texting him, neither of them are that kind of people, she knows I know  it's happening because I said it was  okay because she said it helped some when I wasn't understanding (previous relationship was 2 years with him) and recently with the increase in exchange texts between them, even when I'm with her  in person worries me as I  don't know what it  is  they talk  about, and I don't ask, I put a lot of trust  into her.",t2_2bp89gc4,False,,0,False,My girlfriend (17F) recent event....,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_etmf74,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579957102.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(sorry for length + formatting + grammar)&lt;/p&gt;

I think I’m using caffeine to treat my depression because I like the high it gives me.

,depression_help,"Trust me, I'm not technically qualified to give advice on nearly anything, but I'd simply like to share the single most effective tactic I've used to combat my chemical imbalance. 

Firstly, we have all our own strengths and weaknesses, and for many of you this simply may not be an viable option. 

UPDATE: I initally wanted to give advice but feel I cant do that without providing my personal story.

If just a single one of you finds comfort in being reminded you're not alone in fighting an internal battle, it has been worth writing what may become the longest personal essay I've written since.. high school?

So as not to waste the time of any of you who either have physical limitations or litany of other valid reasons this just isn't feasible option:
My secret is 45 minutes of DAILY aerobic exercise.

I know this isn't earth shattering news to the majority of you, but I promise that if your mind/body connections reacts to exercise in a way similar to mine, this is possibly the single most important thing you can do for your overall wellbeing.

Let me provide you with my own ""scientific"" life data to back this up. I've always been naturally athletic;  I'm talking high school varsity level at peak, not overly gifted in the least bit. But up through high school, I had always been physically active whether through games and practices or workouts to gain an edge in between seasons.

For most of us, high school is the last time we had a chance to participate in team sports or other organized activities that forced us to keep active. Once that outlet was gone, it took a few years for me to gradually notice that I was getting more and more depressed as time went on.

Back story, I'd moreso struggled with anxiety rather than that empty feeling of good ol' depression through my childhood and adolescence. So much so that I would have full blown panic attacks, including crying, freezing up and being nearly paralyzed by fear, and sometimes even puking before and sometimes during games or any performance-type thing, starting middle school.

Im blessed to say I have AWESOME parents (another incalculable asset in the personal battle against my own head.) So one day when I was 11 or 12, my mom kind of lied about where we were going and before I realized the situation, we were on a couch across from a therapist. (She had to deceive me, she knew what my reaction was going to be.) I FLIPPED, acting so embarrassing and infantile that to this day I cant believe that man fought through my bull**** and ended up being a tremendous help. I'm talking at least the first 5-6 sessions of me fighting with whichever parent brought me to even get out of the car, going and in telling the Dr to f*** himself in 100 different ways for 30 mins straight while he talked with and assured my parents this was an extreme, but natural way of acting out when feeling cornered etc., walking out of his office multiple times while he just calmly followed me as I circled the halls of the office building just ignoring him until time was up. 

Anyways, after utterly horrifying my parents and wasting God knows how much of their money, I realized he was an truly awesome dude that just wanted to do whatever he could to help teach me coping mechanisms etc etc. I think he won me over cause he told me it was cool if I wanted to swear when telling him about how I felt , and in turn he also swore in conversation, maybe a tactic to make me feel equal? Or like I was just talking to a friend? Cause at 12, the F word just feels cool to say, right? Long story, he made more progress than we could have hoped for in less than a couple years.
Side note: It was all him and the techniques, SSRI's never really seemed to do anything for me, I tried 3 different ones over the course of about 6 months each. Havent taken them since I was like 14

Anyways, fast forward about 15 years and honestly didn't realize how deeply I had spiraled into the prototypical depressive state. Was unaware my s/o and parents had even been keeping in touch behind my back to (in a wholesome way, not the negative connotation) to try to team up and make sure the were doing what they could to help.

I didnt have an aha! moment, but decided I could no longer accept that I was essentially on autopilot and allowing time to trickle away to the point of years. Years since I had felt.. Alive? Enthusiastic? Hard to describe the feeling, or lack thereof.

Anyways, as an adult, it seemed like a no-brainer to see if the therapist who's advice had been paramount not so long ago was still in the area.  Luckily for me, he was, although I didn't know his expertise was technically in adolescents, and didnt typically treat adults.

This is irrelevant, but I can't explain how heartwarming it was when he realized the kid who, in his words, ""fought like a feral animal"" against having to see him had ended up holding him in such high regard that I wanted his help again. This is irrelevant, but I hope he felt as validated as I feel he deserved to.

So we catch up a bit, laugh about what an absolute maniac i had been in our first meetings,  and got to business. He asked the usual questions like what brings you back, describe how you feel, and a couple other basic things.  When I had given him all the basics, he just sighed and said,"" welp kiddo you just hit every bullet point describing classic clinical depression.""

So he took a moment to gather his thoughts and told me based on what he knew about me, the usual approach of long term cognitive behavior therapy would be a complete waste of our time. He also knew that though my brain had fully developed since I was 13,  SSRI's weren't something he thought we should try again, especially I wasnt going to be seeing him weekly

Then he brought up the fact that I had first seen him because of my anxiety getting to actually get out on the field during a game and asked if I still played whether in gym basketball league or did local 5k races or anything like that. When I told said no and that I hadn't been going to the gym or going on runs for a years ,he laughed and shook his head.

He was almost giddy when he told me he'd bet his house that based on my lifestyle, all I needed to do was add a daily aerobic exercise routine back into my life. Make it 45 minutes a day a priority, if all possible. He explained the science of endorphin release afterwards and all that and then we talked about how crucial staying motivated to do it every day was.

So after years stuck in a pointless depression, on a 10 scale of 1 really depressed and 10 as always happy, I went from a 2-3 to a 5-6 in a about 6 weeks. It usually boosts to about an 8 for a couple hours directly after whatever exercise I do. The gym high is real.

I'll leave you with this: while this isn't possible for everyone and won't work for everyone, it is 100% worth a shot. If you've never done any training, start small. A 15 minute walk maybe. But do it everyday and gradually increase as you feel able. I promise over a relatively short period, you will feel SOMETHING. And hey if not, it's still good for your heart.

Whatever keeps you going, keep doing it. Try to win your daily battles and remember that it's always worth fighting for yourself.",t2_4fkouqrh,False,,0,False,Fight to stay active,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'STORY'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_etljws,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},STORY,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579952134.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I&amp;#39;m not technically qualified to give advice on nearly anything, but I&amp;#39;d simply like to share the single most effective tactic I&amp;#39;ve used to combat my chemical imbalance. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Recently, my sister got blocked by all her friends and her ex (they were good friends even after the break up) why? my sister was depressed and needed to talk, they ignored her, and then blocked her. They left her crying and asking questions which made me feel very sad and angry. Shes actually the most sweetest person on earth, and it really makes my blood boil seeing her sad. 

I just don't understand it, how someone could just ignore someone whos really in need of support. I really thought that her friends were good people, i had faith in them and i lost that faith. Im still very heated about this because, it makes me think alot of myself when i needed help and no one did. I really tried not to cry infront of her, i want to be a strong big sister and support her all the way, like she deserves. She deserves good treatment. I just cannot believe how cruel they were to her. I cannot believe i trusted them. i cannot fcking believe i had faith in those people.

Me being the protective sister that i am, im supporting her and will talk to those ""friends"" because i just cannot get behind why they thought what they did was any good.

,depression_help,"Hi, fellas. I will tell my history. I'm writing this at 4:46 AM on January 24, 2020. Well, I think all of this has began at early 2019. Before It all. I has to introduce myself right? My name...Well, I won't tell it. You can call me as you wish. Born early 2000s. I live in Brazil. Let's go. Like I said before, everything has start at all early 2019 (I guess). I start to imaginating me fucking with some people especially my nieces one is a kid and another a baby and I cumming on it. This impacted me...you now? Suicide. But this happen to another people why this impacted me? I imaginated me having a pee pee on my friend's girlfriend. Have a period of time that I imaginated people without their eyes. Actually has periods that I had fear of becoming blind. I don't if is because I have made jokes about a ""friend"" that have one eye blind. He have his moments of stupid speech but this don't justified what I have done. Have a time that I watched Gotham (2014) that Is a tv show. There is a Joker on the series, and for a period I wanted to be him, kill people you know? Why? Why? Why? Have a time in mid 2018 that I was in conflict religiously. I wanted to know that If god or satan really exist. I guess that I've prayed for my mom die? I've prayed to rain? For both? You know now I'm in conflict with the numbers 12 and 18.  My nieces have been born in years that ends there. I don't know what to do. I am racist? I can't have a relationship with women. Well, once I was masturbating and when I was going to thought the name of my niece. Once I was watching porn and remembered of the name of father of my friend. It happens with one of nieces too. I think it's because the father of my friend will become our neighbor (I guess) And I have interect with my niece then this happens. And I always hated to interect with children. And this had happens. I start to hate recently my family. Seems like that the universe want me to die. I had for a period bipolarity once I was happy then sad. I have social anxiety. My life sucks. And I'm only 17. Seems like nothing is real. Some days ago I've dreamed that I was fucking with my mother. This is because that have porn video that have this genre. I start to believe that I would live a 2nd life because I want to be happy but I can't anymore. I must believe that this is a disease/mental illness because If it won't means that... I don't know actually what that means. Help me please. I'm afraid of taking a bus to search for work and lost my self. I read something I think I'm dumb and must die. Well on 5th grade I hit my self with books then... I thought I'll kill myself with overdose. But now any way must work. And more and more world goes crazy I thought kill myself is the best. I f you could help, I'll be grateful. You know what happens with guys like me on prision i saying about what ive imaginated. If you could help, I'll be grateful. I thought if i was in prision i would kill a police guard and laugh just to the others dont hurt me. People says, ""Death shouldn't have to be an option"", read this fucking history about me. Do you think that I have a chance? The shame of having a mental illness unknown, is bigger than me. If you could help, I'll be grateful. Ps: i've written this on my smartphone on my bed. I don't know why I've said this (PS) The imaginations has happen equal to animals, dog. I don't know why but i like me doing cool things, i imaginated me likle satan, lucifer, king of hell, prince.

,depression_help,"I have suffered with depression for many years but I've kept it to myself. I've had suicidal thoughts, I've self harmed and suffered constant anxiety but I've kept it hidden from everyone.

I have self-medicated with drink and drugs in the past but luckily my current finances have put a stop to that.

I never wanted to burden people with my problems. I convinced myself I was just sad. Everyone gets sad right?

I have recently separated from my wife and now live alone. Without her and my kids around to keep me busy my mental health has deteriorated. I'm constantly on the verge of bursting into tears and my anxiety is through the roof.

I've never been a very open person. I see friends on Facebook opening up to the world about their problems and I really envy those people. I wish I could pluck up the courage to open up and tell people how I'm feeling.

I'm not a ""macho"" kind of guy. I don't keep things bottled up to prevent me looking weak. I do it because I feel insignificant and and my feelings are of no interest to anyone.

To my Friends and colleagues I probably appear to be a happily married man (I've not even told a lot of people about the split) with a perfectly happy life and I do my best to keep up that appearance.

I don't have any particularly close friends that I talk to about anything personal. I'm almost certain everyone thinks i'm heterosexual (I'm Bi but never felt the need to come out as I was in a 'straight' relationship).

I guess my question is: How do I become a more open person? My problem with opening up has caused me nothing but despair. Luckily I can hide behind ""david smith"" to get my feelings off my chest to a bunch of strangers.

,depression_help,"Hi everyone.
I am new to Reddit. I see my boyfriend use it often, so I figured I'd give it a try to find a sense of community and potentially find some help...
Quick background about myself: I am a 20 year old female... full time college student in STEM. I am on the pre-med track and hope to one day become a physician. I would consider myself to be a bubbly and sweet person on the outside, but I've struggled mentally for nearly my entire life. I went through some pretty rough trauma throughout my childhood as a result of verbal/physical/mental abuse from my mother and losing my father to cancer at 16. I always felt like it was a ""normal"" way to live and built up a lot of stress and anxiety. I grasped control over school/grades because it was the only sense of ""stability"" I could find in my life, and after moving away to college, my depression/anxiety started to catch up with my physical and mental health. I have been in and out of doctor's offices/hospitals for panic attacks/tachycardia, digestive issues (polyps and potentially ulcers), chronic headaches, etc.)
Update to now: Over the summer, I was going to the emergency rooms often for extremely high heart rates/blood pressure as a result of panic attacks. My depression and anxiety reached an all time high, and I decided it was time to get help. I have been in counselling for close to 6 months now, and I have been prescribed 40 mg of CeleXa and 30 mg of Vyvanse (in hopes of curbing mild/moderate BED as a result of depression)... I spent a lot of time in survival mode and eventually worked myself up to attend yoga every day, eat out slightly less, spend less time in bed, and attempt to get things accomplished. For the past few weeks, I feel like everything is just going in reverse. I often find myself in bed... I often find myself with insane cravings for random foods to fix my sadness... I want to cry and can't find the energy to do anything. I know it's a cycle and recovery isn't just a straight upwards trend... but it feels so disheartening when I am finally feeling better and then things crash and burn again. I was starting to lose weight and feel more confident... spend more time studying... eating better... etc. I know that I can't go from nothing to everything without burning myself out, but I also don't know why I can't just feel better.

,depression_help,"I am a feminine gay guy. So, not only am I guy, but I like being feminine too in my appearance and behavior. And especially online, I keep on and on and on coming across SO many people against homosexuality, and/or people against men being allowed to be feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

And what I have been using since I was a kid to try to help make me feel better is feel-good escapism in the forms of movies and shows. But as an adult, I can't even use that, since the type of movies and shows I'm interested in keeps excluding homosexuals and feminine guys. And even when they don't, the representation is poorly handled.

&amp;#x200B;

I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I've seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn't exist within these genres.

&amp;#x200B;

But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just don't know how to deal with it.",t2_59tp48gy,False,,0,False,"I want to learn to appreciate the positive gay inclusion and acceptance, and stop letting homophobia and gay exclusion and alienation burden me","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_esu3k5,False,dark,,public,53,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,53,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579819764.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a feminine gay guy.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love fantasy, I love science fiction, I love superhero stuff, I love animated stuff. Literally only example of a feminine male character I&amp;#39;ve seen depicted in a good proper way is in the Youtube-exclusive animated show Hazbin Hotel. And, when it comes to a homosexual male romance where you get to see the two males fall in love, share their first kiss, become a couple, and stay a couple without either one of them dying at any point? To my knowledge, it doesn&amp;#39;t exist within these genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I try very hard to stay positive, and appreciate what I DO have as opposed to what I dont. I got that Hazbin Hotel character Angel Dust. And I got an openly gay male character in the ParaNorman movie, and in Avengers: Endgame. So, good step in the right direction I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And furthermore, people ARE getting more gay-supportive, and more people are encouraging gay inclusion. So rationally, I should know better. But I keep feeling so sad and depressed and tired of life, feeling like there is no escapism properly working for me whenever I feel down. And I just don&amp;#39;t know how to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Hello guys,  


It must be like three days that I'm registered on Reddit (sorry if I say something weird or wrong, english isn't my first language, you can correct me if there is a mistake and you feel like it, that's not a problem I hope) and I was trying to give an advice to ""people"" like just an advice that I believed was good to follow if a person was in a bad situation with someone with wrong intentions someday.  


My point was only to help, and I never said in the comment in question that I've got all the knowledge in the world and that my advice was an order or whatever. But yet, somebody just told me that I should not have said what I said (the advice) because in her case (which was a very bad one, like a situation I hope nobody would live, even if I know that everyday people unfortunately experience it and I had too, but I never said that in my comment or in reply to her because I didn't have to and whatever) and I felt really attacked by her. Because she made me really feel like a bad person, as if I was even coupable of what would have happen to her in the past, and she told that BECAUSE she did not do what I was giving as an advice, she lived. But if she did what I have said, she would have been dead, and she made me feel really guilty about it.  


The point is, that I was just trying to help and she didn't have to talk to me like that. I didn't knew where to post what I am posting right now, because for the record, I've been depressed for more than ten years and I experienced like, almost one time a year (one time could be hours, days, weeks or months) of me feeling like I really should kill myself. And I'm even in one of this episode for a few weeks and everyday I try to help at least one person a day. Not to feel better about myself, but because I want to help as many people as I can and I know that it could help. It might not always work or be the better thing to do in some situations or for some people but I cannot know everybody's lives and everyone's situation and as a highly sensitive person too, I am ALWAYS trying to write/speak in the way of not trying to hurt anyone, to be as kind as possible (I am a kind person actually, so I try to be it even if I feel like I just want to die) and so on.  


I was feeling like a total mess last night because of the comments of this girl, because she was really telling me that I was like kind of guilty of giving not any advice but like, I was helping people to get killed in some way. She did not actually say that but I really take it badly and I still feel like, because of what she told me (a total stranger, yes) I treated myself like I was right to believe that I should kill myself because I was just a piece of shit to the world and because I was angry too and really bad, at a moment, by brother tried to told me a joke that wasn't funny and I just talked to him really really badly so he got the impression that I didn't even deserved to be talked to and left. To some point, I've been crying for hours, feeling suicidal, and even went to my mom who just told me to stay away from internet (yes at that point, but it was just some girl on reddit but, still) and I felt terrible because I don't have any real good support anywhere in real life.  


I don't even know why I am posting that, I guess I need it out of my chest, and was in research of kind words, and good people. I don't know if anyone would even comment or saw my post, but well. Even if I don't have a plan to kill myself and don't want any of course, I feel like I should die and I am so tired of feeling this way. I know I don't deserve that because I am a kind person and a loving person who cares a lot. I tried to post this on another sub but while I was writing, I guess I just should post it here. I don't know if I have done the best thing, but I have to go, so I guess I will see in the day if anyone would have answer me.

Ive been feeling extremy bad for the last couple of months, i havent gone to school for around 2 months and whenevrt i try i get up for school i get extreme anxiety and feel like the teachers are gonna blame me or something? 

I also sleep really bad, some nights i dont sleep at all and then i also cant go to school because i fall down and sleep on the ground at like 8 in the morning. My eating habit is also really messed up, i eat once every other day or so and dont drink that much water. Sometimes i feel like taking my own life, but the only thing stopping me is when i think of my mom/brother/girlfriend and what they would feel finding me. 

I have tried contacting my medical center(?) but they have just said that since i currently live in an apartment away from my official housing (because of school) that they cant do much unless its something serious that needs imminent help, called a psyciatric help center and they said the same thing. 

I feel so lost and abandoned and i dont know what to do, i have no drive to do anything. Im just sitting alone in my apartment and going out every other day to get food. The only thing that keeps me going right now is my girlfriend.

,depression_help,"hi. i am 17 and i feel truly helpless about my life. ive been having severe depression on and off for about a year (the last 3 or 4 months consistently severe) and before that my episodes varied in range but rarely ever had any gaps between them. this has been going on since about 13, getting worse over time.

last year my two siblings moved out on their own terms (we have an abusive father and parents have a toxic falling in-and-out relationship) and after years of my father denying going to therapy or getting help, he finally decided to let us (me and my parents) see a counsellor.

i have been going to counselling for a year already and me and my counsellor both have made many pleas about taking me to a psychiatrist for my depression and anxiety. my parents said no.

they don't want me to SEE if i need help, they don't want me to have any option at all to be diagnosed, because of the possibility of getting medication. as much as both me and my counsellor have explained the misconceptions and logistics of prescription antidepressants, my mother still says she won't let me go see a psychiatrist.

i started cbt a few months ago because my mother is convinced that i can simply use cbt to overcome my issues, and that medication wouldn't help, and wants me to ""try it out first"" like i can just pick either. the problem is, i struggle to follow the workbook or the application of learned tools when my body is physically off and tired, i'm procrastinatory and moody, etc. which i can't really snap out of just by ""willing myself"" to.

(this is because with severe depression, you usually need combination treatment to tackle it.)

i'm not sure what to do.

i want to ask again to see if i can at least try some natural supplements (st. john's wort, higher doses of L-theanine? [i have taken some before but not consistently / for depression, only during anxiety spirals / attacks] ) but i am afraid of even bringing it up.



the main thing i want to know is:



would i be able to get antidepressants by myself at this age? i can't get a prescription currently. are there ways to get prozac or zoloft online? are there over the counter antidepressants that i can get without prescription that will do the job? genuinely looking for answers..google isn't my best friend here.



i can't handle my depression anymore. please let me know your experiences and what you think i should do. i just wanna go about this the best way possible.

,depression_help,"This is going to be long but I appreciate any responses and suggestions whether nice or harsh.

I met a girl from out of state while vising a friend. We hit it off really well and it looked like she was into me and I was very into her.

After I left we spoke and texted each other daily. Things seemed perfect until she disappeared without an  explanation. A few month later she said that she is going to visit my area (her family lives there) and she would really like to see me. When I saw her she apologized for what she did. She was in a terrible relationship before and she was scared of going through what she's been to. In the next few days a purchased a plane ticket to go see her for Christmas.

I came to visit her for Christmas. We had a great time. She knows a lot of people in that small town and literally half the town knew who I was. She told everyone about me. The night before I was about to leave we got into a giant argument which did not make any sense to me at the time. By the end of the argument I learned that she was angry because she didn't know how to deal with the fact that I was leaving. In the end I felt that the argument was totally worth it and it made me realize how much she actually loves me. 

Since I left we have been texting and talking on the daily basis until just recently.

Now here is where depression comes into play... I'm depressed, lost, scared and insecure. I was in a relationship before that lasted for about 8 years. It involved drugs, cheating, threats of suicide and suicide attempts, physical violence (on her side), me questioning my every move and apologizing for things I should not have to.

I feel like that relationship is affecting my new relationship with that new girl. I'm scared to say something because I feel that everything I say is pointless and stupid. She is a very strong woman and I feel like a broken mess. I'm terrified. I do have a ticket to go see her again very soon but I just can't stop thinking. I'm depressed and insecure and most likely for no reason what so ever.

Our communication has cut down drastically and I feel that it's my fault. I don't know what to say without overthinking and my mind goes blank when I speak to her.

I think all these insecurities and terrible thoughts are the reason for the lack of communication. I'm a mess. I can't stop thinking. I want to have an amazing conversation with her and I would like to spend an hour taking to her but I have nothing say. Well..  I have a lot to say but not when it matters. I don't know what to do. I want her to understand that I'm going through stuff and I will do my best to get past all that but what if it turns out to be a lie and I'll be just as miserable as ever. Maybe there is no hope for me. I do text her more often than she replies and it drives me crazy. That being said I'm not texting her non stop. Just here and there. Also, when she does reply she says she misses me and asks about my day but I can't stop feeling like I'm being overbearing.

Let me know if clarification needed if you've gotten this far haha. Thanks. I'm depressed, lonely, bitter, scared, lonely and angry and sometimes I wonder if the next life will have something better to offer.

I've been lonely for way too long (even with that 8 year relationship). There was no love there.

There is so much more... Feel free to dm me and I'll spill my guts out to you if you're interested and/or experienced something similar or ask here if you'd like.

 Any comment will do. I'm not expecting a major breakthrough that'll change my life forever. Just thoughts or if anyone else experienced anything even remotely similar to this. If so, if like to hear about it.

There may be a typo here somewhere or something that isn't clear. Let me know where and I'll explain.

The night before I was about to leave we got into a giant argument which did not make any sense to me at the time. By the end of the argument I learned that she was angry because she didn&amp;#39;t know how to deal with the fact that I was leaving. In the end I felt that the argument was totally worth it and it made me realize how much she actually loves me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I left we have been texting and talking on the daily basis until just recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is where depression comes into play... I&amp;#39;m depressed, lost, scared and insecure. I was in a relationship before that lasted for about 8 years. It involved drugs, cheating, threats of suicide and suicide attempts, physical violence (on her side), me questioning my every move and apologizing for things I should not have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like that relationship is affecting my new relationship with that new girl. I&amp;#39;m scared to say something because I feel that everything I say is pointless and stupid. She is a very strong woman and I feel like a broken mess. I&amp;#39;m terrified. I do have a ticket to go see her again very soon but I just can&amp;#39;t stop thinking. I&amp;#39;m depressed and insecure and most likely for no reason what so ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our communication has cut down drastically and I feel that it&amp;#39;s my fault. I don&amp;#39;t know what to say without overthinking and my mind goes blank when I speak to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think all these insecurities and terrible thoughts are the reason for the lack of communication. I&amp;#39;m a mess. I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking. I want to have an amazing conversation with her and I would like to spend an hour taking to her but I have nothing say. Well..  I have a lot to say but not when it matters. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I want her to understand that I&amp;#39;m going through stuff and I will do my best to get past all that but what if it turns out to be a lie and I&amp;#39;ll be just as miserable as ever. Maybe there is no hope for me. I do text her more often than she replies and it drives me crazy. That being said I&amp;#39;m not texting her non stop. Just here and there. Also, when she does reply she says she misses me and asks about my day but I can&amp;#39;t stop feeling like I&amp;#39;m being overbearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if clarification needed if you&amp;#39;ve gotten this far haha. Thanks. I&amp;#39;m depressed, lonely, bitter, scared, lonely and angry and sometimes I wonder if the next life will have something better to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been lonely for way too long (even with that 8 year relationship). There was no love there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is so much more... Feel free to dm me and I&amp;#39;ll spill my guts out to you if you&amp;#39;re interested and/or experienced something similar or ask here if you&amp;#39;d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any comment will do. I&amp;#39;m not expecting a major breakthrough that&amp;#39;ll change my life forever. Just thoughts or if anyone else experienced anything even remotely similar to this. If so, if like to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be a typo here somewhere or something that isn&amp;#39;t clear. Let me know where and I&amp;#39;ll explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone. Hope you&amp;#39;re all doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

And naturally something else messes up... my brother and his girlfriend,  whom i have grown to love as a sister in the 6 years they have been together, breakup and it also seems like it didnt end well. Sorry for the novel but what im trying to say is im starting to feel like &amp;quot;Forever &amp;quot;is a lie a  fairy tail...and i am scared to death at it is going to happen to me if i love someone again. I am terrified that i am going to loose another important person because nothing ever works out, but im also afraid to loose people because i dont feel any thing good anymore... i need help, but i dont know where to go or who to talk to...&lt;/p&gt;

Please excuse my absurd rant, but I feel like venting online is oddly therapeutic.

Currently, my perfectionism has ruined everything. I’m never satisfied with any of my academic work. When I get consistent A’s, I feel as if it’s simply my responsibility. If I don’t get A’s, I obviously feel like a complete,utter failure and a disgusting insect of a human being. 

Everything was “fine”, I was pushing all of my emotions to the back of my head until now. My high school midterms went  incredibly smooth, but after that I couldn’t help but feel suicidal. I’ve realised that I’m not satisfied with anything, and that I can’t keep succeeding for the rest of my life. I’ve always dealt with some sort of mental ailment (from extreme anxiety disorder, to bulimia, depression, anorexia, etc) so that only fuels my relentless thoughts.

The fact that I’m quite young also feeds into my suicidal thoughts, since this is supposed to be the “easiest” part of my life. I was close to killing myself, I even had it all planned out! Who knows if I was brave enough to actually do it, but I had a note and everything.

The only thing that stopped me was my mother, since I couldn’t possibly throw my life away after all her years of sacrifices;not while living under her roof. I’m seeking help now, and I’ve been getting evaluated for mental disorders, and will possibly get medication. Even my psychologist agrees that my perfectionism could very likely be the root of most (if not all) of my emotional distress.

My question is, does anyone else feel like this? Perfectionism is an awful curse! I feel nauseated writing this since I’m supposed to be studying for 2 tests, but my depression has made it physically impossible for me to concentrate or study. I absolutely abhor making mistakes, and I can’t help but feel my crushing expectations piling above me, and weighing my down like a sack of bricks.

&lt;p&gt;The fact that I’m quite young also feeds into my suicidal thoughts, since this is supposed to be the “easiest” part of my life. I was close to killing myself, I even had it all planned out! Who knows if I was brave enough to actually do it, but I had a note and everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing that stopped me was my mother, since I couldn’t possibly throw my life away after all her years of sacrifices;not while living under her roof. I’m seeking help now, and I’ve been getting evaluated for mental disorders, and will possibly get medication. Even my psychologist agrees that my perfectionism could very likely be the root of most (if not all) of my emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, does anyone else feel like this? Perfectionism is an awful curse! I feel nauseated writing this since I’m supposed to be studying for 2 tests, but my depression has made it physically impossible for me to concentrate or study. I absolutely abhor making mistakes, and I can’t help but feel my crushing expectations piling above me, and weighing my down like a sack of bricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly don’t know what was the point of this post, but writing to a community of strangers seems to be comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I've struggled with depression since I was 13 (24F currently). I've experienced all the typical symptoms that come along with it. I have a great husband and a really tight circle of friends, all of whom know and understand my struggles either from personal experience with depression themselves, or from being there to help me out of particularly bad funks in the past. 

Recently, I've been using snapchat to stay in touch with all of them (my husband and I moved a few states away a few years ago for college, but are planning to move back this summer). I'll send them a message on snap and it'll be marked as ""seen"" but they won't reply for a while, or sometimes not at all. Sometimes I snap them four or five times a week, which I know can be a little clingy, so I understand not responding all the time. Usually it's something silly I come across during the day, or something that doesn't necessarily warrant a response. Our communications are the same as they've always been, which is what makes me question if anything is actually wrong. 

In my head, I'm either being too clingy or not reaching out to them enough. When they don't respond, I have horrible anxiety and wonder if I've done something wrong, or I'll start to suspect that they're finally getting tired of me and wish I would just leave them alone. I can't tell if that's my depression talking, or if they really are getting sick of me. I don't want to outright ask them, because I'm afraid I'm being to clingy and needy as is.

,depression_help,"Disclaimer: I'm posting this for a friend who wishes to be anonymous. I'm pasting it exactly as he wrote it.
It's a long story.

--

A little background before I tell the story.
My girlfriend and I posted it anonymously as a reply on quora, and somehow a few people correctly guessed who we are. 

Now, the story.

Yours before we met, my girlfriend was in a serious accident and is unable to have children.. One of her biggest dreams.
This resulted in a depression that she's been struggling with ever since.

Over a year ago she read a question on quora that peeked her interest, and she asked me if I'd allow her to do some things.
My biggest wish is for her to be happy, so I agreed.

We'd already agreed on the day, and I was to do nothing at all on my own. Not even move or talk. She is in absolute control.
I'm approximately half a head taller than her, but really slim. And she's at least 10 times stronger than me.. This is important for some of the following to make sense. 
This is going to be very detailed! It's also to sound really weird to many people. 

Here is what happened the following Saturday.
She woke me up with breakfast in bed and fed me before picking me up and carrying me to the bathroom to bathe me very thoroughly (and gently)
After drying me, she dressed me up as a doll.. Complete with makeup and a pink bow in my hair.
Throughout the day, she took perfect care of me. Even the simplest things like going to the toilet, washing my hands, brushing my teeth.. She took care of everything. 

I admit, it was weird. I felt uncomfortable about some of the things at the time, but I also noticed how relaxed she was. And I saw a subtle smile and the look in her eyes. 

She played with me like a doll, and by the end of the day I actually didn't want it to stop. 
I slept in a guest bed that night (a stand-in for a doll bed), being tucked in tightly and kissed goodnight. 

We talked about it in the morning, and we agreed to try it again next weekend.. 
She went out and bought lots of cute outfits in my size, really looking forward to it. 

Since then, I've been many different kinds of toys (always toys.. We never even discussed anything else. And I'd have refused to be a child) 
Dolls, teddy bears, action figures. 

This has never even remotely been of any kind of sexual nature. 

Just seeing how this has changed her life and made her happy makes it worth it. But honestly, I've started looking forward to it more because of the amazing feeling of having her complete, undivided attention every weekend. Saturday and Sunday. 
Her therapist has also taken an interest in this, and is extremely impressed.. Calling me a hero (I'm not. I just want the love of my life to be happy) 

Now on to the problem. 
A few days after I posted the story, a few friends at work came up to me and asked if I was okay (?) 
I responded that, yes. Why wouldn't I be? 
They looked really concerned and I noticed them talking to others, looking over at me from time to time. 

I was called in to my supervisor's office later, and she started asking about my wellbeing. She told me that she'd heard about the story. And she'd be happy to help me.
She'd dealt with abuse before, and I was obviously in distress.

Too many people know about this now. And it's come to the point where police shows up at our door due to reports of domestic abuse.
My girlfriend (fiancé) is badly affected by this, and her depression is worse than ever. She's also no longer comfortable continuing this.

I've started telling everyone to stay away from us (our family is completely supportive of us. They didn't know, but they've seen the change she's gone through)
I'm about to get terminated from my job because ""I'm causing a hostile environment"" and generally being rude to people who are just ""trying to save me"" from my ""abusive girlfriend""

I feel like I'm justified in cutting ties with everyone involved, as well as telling them to f off.. They've pretty much ruined our lives, and I'm not sure if this situation can even be fixed at this point.

I was nearly arrested last night for screaming at a couple of ""concerned citizens"" in a restaurant to mind their own business.

I'm considering legal action against the involved parties.
Also.. I don’t know what to do anymore :(",t2_4ej6tapp,False,,0,False,How we dealt with depression..

This week alone been going between utterly disorientated, ungrounded, and feeling  mentally and physically disconected from things. As if their is a film over between my brain and the rest of the world.

I can bairly get myself to get outside onto the porch for fresh air, and sunshine, muchless  take a short walk!

Going stir fucking crazy being eager to get out of this fucking donky dick sucking depression, and wanting weather that doesn't disorient me, or generally uter shit.

I want nice weather so as I don't slip on my ass getting fresh air.

I hate having to put a somebitch in a hurt locker like that, but, fucking christ. I've had it with them not doing fuck.

Less and less motivated to even get out of bed, to fucking shower. It was already low.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week alone been going between utterly disorientated, ungrounded, and feeling  mentally and physically disconected from things. As if their is a film over between my brain and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can bairly get myself to get outside onto the porch for fresh air, and sunshine, muchless  take a short walk! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It snowing off and on, bouncing from a super awesome sunny cozy 55-60F(15C), the the universe saying: psyche, trolled you! It&amp;#39;s back to fucking 10F (-12C) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For at least a week practically every bone and joint&amp;#39;s fucking sore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going stir fucking crazy being eager to get out of this fucking donky dick sucking depression, and wanting weather that doesn&amp;#39;t disorient me, or generally uter shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want nice weather so as I don&amp;#39;t slip on my ass getting fresh air. A part of this issue is the fucking city does just about dick to keep everything plastered with snow melt, clay, and what ever the fuck else we can pull out of our ass to have grip to walk and drive. But oh no! &amp;#39;Why bother, just stay in side to  have cookies!&amp;#39; (and like I told the fucking moronic idiot on the phone: fuck that and fuck your division for being arogantly lazy, you have a fuck ton of trucks that can and will plaster the shit out of the sidewalks, or I&amp;#39;ll dig up every fucking asshole I can to A) vote your boss from office, B) sue into chapter 13 for being incompitent cocker fucks it was only THEN they got off there fucking ass to do anything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate having to put a somebitch in a hurt locker like that, but, fucking christ. I&amp;#39;ve had it with them not doing fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Before today, I didn't even know or even seriously consider that I may be depressed. To me it just seemed normal, and probably due to the gradual increase of the severity I simply didn't connect the dots.

From what I can recall it's been going on since I was around 12, back in 2014. First I remember becoming quite lazy and finding getting anything done an incredibly hard challenge. I thought it was just because I was a teenager, and lazyness is a normal teenager status. Then I started having a lot of anger issues, I'd get pissed off for the most minute things, I had an incredibly short fuse but I just thought it was also normal teenager behavior. Eventually I managed to suppress those explosions so they'd go off in my head but no one would notice. I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy a lot, like math, and went from reading 30 books a year to reading 0 last year.

I think I was around 15 when the first suicidal thought occurred. Every time I'd fuck up and get grounded or yelled at, or faced consequences for my actions I'd just think over and over again that I wasn't worth anything. Those thoughts disappeared for some time, but arose back last year. I, again, thought it was normal. I think the reason they stopped is because I was at a relative high in my life, I had entered college at 16 years of age and everyone I knew was proud of me, and I felt good about myself. Or so I think I thought.

I feel like I can speak for any teenager out there that mastubating is normal. Yet I'm not sure when, it became a daily thing, and then 2 or 3 times per day. Also I stopped showering, I don't even know why. I just didn't. I'd go into the bathroom, turn on the water and just sit on the toilet looking at it or my phone. I stopped cleaning my room and then stopped washing my clothes. I'd wait till the last pair of underwear, maybe reuse it a few times and then wash enough clothes for a week, while months of clothes were piled up. My dandruff got much worse, and the suicidal thoughts came back every once in a while. Not sure if it's got anything to do with this but I started driving really aggressively, well past the speed limit even after a ticket, something I didn't do when I got my license. Lastly, I've always been very thin, as a male I still weighed around 120lbs ish. Now I'm around 130, which I know is still nothing, and I don't think I'm fat or anything like that, but I'd never in my life gained weight, and suddenly I was 10 lbs heavier in a matter of a few months. All of this paragraph started around the same time.

Today I was talking to a friend of mine over the phone and for some reason he just asked me: ""are you depressed?"" Which left me thinking, yet my college classes distracted me for enough time. Today at dinner my mom finally lashed out over my lack of hygiene, it's then that I realized I haven't showered in months, nearly a year of sometimes washing my hair or just standing under the water every once in a while.

I showered and it dawned on me that I, probably have depression. The mere realization made me cry more than I've cried in years. I read all about ""seek help"" and ""tell your parents about it"" but I'm kind of ashamed to admit it. They've given everything to provide for me and my sister, and I've got all the ingredients for what I'd assume is a normal and functioning life. It feels like I have no right to be feeling like this when there's people who have it much worse than me.

Im posting it here because I need anonymous support. I'm not yet ready to admit it out loud,but I think I'm depressed.

,depression_help,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ♥",t2_2x0x085x,False,,0,False,Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'PROVIDING SUPPORT'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_erxx2i,False,dark,,public,122,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},PROVIDING SUPPORT,False,122,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579656443.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context I&amp;#39;m a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast.

Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:&lt;/strong&gt; This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It&amp;#39;s a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I&amp;#39;m spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a pet/plant:&lt;/strong&gt; I know this isn&amp;#39;t a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don&amp;#39;t exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don&amp;#39;t have the kind of money to take care of an animal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognize your signs:&lt;/strong&gt; What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I&amp;#39;ve had to learn... Which leads me to #5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing toxic behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I&amp;#39;m sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to &lt;em&gt;forcing&lt;/em&gt; myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that&amp;#39;s out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I&amp;#39;ve actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That&amp;#39;s just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I&amp;#39;m a penny pincher).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having something to look forward to:&lt;/strong&gt; A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don&amp;#39;t feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad days will happen:&lt;/strong&gt; When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It&amp;#39;s just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you&amp;#39;re willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It&amp;#39;s okay to cry, it&amp;#39;s okay to take a break and &amp;quot;grieve&amp;quot; so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it&amp;#39;s just a bad day/week or something more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-love/Self-care:&lt;/strong&gt; If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you&amp;#39;re not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it&amp;#39;s hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other&amp;#39;s accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don&amp;#39;t see those &amp;quot;flaws&amp;quot; that keep you up at night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another side of &lt;strong&gt;Perspective:&lt;/strong&gt; This may not apply to everyone, but I&amp;#39;d say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed &amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot;. Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn&amp;#39;t the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn&amp;#39;t choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn&amp;#39;t what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn&amp;#39;t success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn&amp;#39;t even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ♥&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help," ***Disclaimer: I’m writing this after just waking up at 10pm after three hours of sleep, before a cup of tea and my toast has gone cold already, so there will be a lot of tangents and discordance in what I write.***

Depression can be experienced differently and uniquely by each person, but overall there are some things that everyone who suffers with it can relate to and understand, no matter what end of the scale you’re on. It seldom comes alone, usually paired with anxiety of some kind, BPD, OCD or something like insomnia.

I’ll give you an example of how it’s hit me today, I’ve spent the past few days around people I love and care about more than I can put into words here, with a lot of laughter and love - yet I’ve been feeling *off*. Slept okay, eaten well, generally been happy. But I have that sinking feeling, I had all day long to play video games, watch films and essentially do what I please, but I didn’t have any energy, any focus, or any want - I wanted to *want* to do those things. I even tried, but half an hour later and I couldn’t manage it. I felt so drained. For no logical reason, I hadn’t done a workout, I’d managed 6 hours sleep and I was hydrated and had nothing in my mind bothering me.

I fell asleep about two hours later at 7pm after going for a walk with music to try and clear my mind and get some fresh air for a second wind to carry me through the evening until bed, but it didn’t really help, I still felt awful. Woke up around 10pm, tried to force myself back to sleep so I wasn’t out of sync, but here I am, writing and adding to this essay at half past midnight.

Of all the things that I could be bothered by with depression, mentioned mostly above, what really cripples me about it is the fact that it changes who I am. By this, I mean that usually, I’m quite jovial, I’m sarcastic, witty, laugh about it all kind of person, but when I feel like I do now, it’s hard to crack a joke, or to think of one. It’s tough to laugh at the banterous insults that we usually throw at one another which all mean “I love you”.

The worst part of this change is that people think that you’re mad at them, that they’ve done something and it’s their fault. That because you aren’t all smiles and you’ve put headphones on, in an effort to listen to music and regain some balance, that you’re trying to drown them out or ignore them when you aren’t, when it’s actually because you need music to chill but you don’t want to force them to listen to it because your music tastes differ.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the time on social media, there’s posts and memes and that sorta stuff where it’s referenced in either a super serious way, trying to raise awareness, or as many do, use the jokes as a coping mechanism so you don’t cry yourself into a hot mess about your problems. Most of the time when I see these posts and memes, my only interaction is to like it and if it’s a good meme; save it. Seldom do I comment or contribute in any fashion - unless it’s a friend in need.

So this suggests that we do in fact share common attributes of depression and I’m sure if you want to get technical, then that’s why it’s becoming more recognised and diagnosable in people. But there’s nothing better when going through some of the horrible experiences and illnesses to know that you aren’t the only one who is dealing with it, or has made it out the other side of it.

For now I can’t recall exactly who, my mind is telling me it’s Russell Howard, but he makes a point about how “stress” is simply a rebrand of the word “unhappy” and he gives examples.

“I’m stressed out about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general”, would be something you’d say and we all accept that’s the way life is and there’s not much to be done about it, but if you said “I’m *unhappy* about work, the mortgage, the kids and life in general”, we try to do something about it because we don’t want to be unhappy. Because being stressed has become the norm and being unhappy is okay in part, but not as a continuous feeling.

This makes a ton of sense to me, it really spoke to me and connected some of the dots. I was about thirteen when I first started suffering from insomnia and depression, now at the time I didn’t realise that’s what it was really, in my mind, I was just sad about being a fat kid, rarely fitting in (no pun intended) and I would get bored of not falling asleep at night - so I’d play video games and eventually fell for the nonsense that it was the screen keeping me up.

To clarify, I am aware about bluelight and trouble games etc cause with sleeplessness so to make it crystal clear, I was struggling to fall asleep with nothing going on, until approx 3-4am when I’d then get bored and get up since school was only a few hours away. There’s a lot more that was happening in my life back then that looking back on it I was able to realise why I felt how I did etc, but I won’t go into that for personal reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a few weeks ago, I attended a mental illness seminar for the benefit of someone else. 99% of what was discussed during the two hour event was stuff me and this other person had already known so it felt kinda useless going, but you go just in case that 1% helps. What **did** help was that the other people attending were exactly that; they were human. People looking for answers and where those leading the seminar couldn’t answer, others in the room chimed in with what worked for them etc.

You had realness, people opening up about themselves and loved ones instead of staying silent for fear of being different or embarrassed **AND IT WORKED**. You could feel everyone in the room relax and a few people looked like they wanted to cry because they realised themselves and their loved ones are not alone. After the event came to a close, a woman came straight over to me from another table because I’d spoken up about my insomnia when the topic of ‘how to use positive language’ or something like that:

I’d mentioned how suffering with insomnia and poor sleep patterns, ‘jokey’ phrases and greetings can quickly become commonplace and stick for a long time, which if you have thick skin and a good sense of humour can be brushed off, but even then it can bring you from bad to worse.

So I gave the example that, when you suffer with it, you can often miss daylight and all the usual 9-5 things in life that other people do on a daily basis - even just getting some shopping. Then there’s the fact that you begin to hate yourself. Another day wasted. You’ve still got to mentally prepare yourself for it all tomorrow and make sure you do it because you’re on day three with no food.

You have to settle yourself down in an hour in order to make sure you have enough energy to do tomorrow and reset your pattern. You haven't showered yet, if you do, it could wake you up and have you up all night again, but if you don’t it’s something else you have to do tomorrow before going anywhere.

It can all stem from just being out of sync for one day. That’s all it takes, one day. Going to bed early, or being unable to sleep at night and you can be stuck in a bad loop for days to weeks and breaking the cycle is tough. If you live with other people, you can’t do something engaging during the night to keep you awake, usually because it rarely comes with zero noise. Or because your parents say you can’t do it and you need to sleep. For me it’s anxiety that I’ll wake someone and I find sleep to be a precious thing, so I don’t want to deprive others of that.

By the time that the sun is up and people are shuffling about to go to work and go about their day, you’re totalled, spent and utterly shattered because you’ve done very little but be awake when you want to sleep. For me, energy drinks only do two things, they make me awake for 10 minutes and then hardcore crash, and they make me pee. Same goes for tea and coffee. So before you know it, when it’s 10am and you’re trying super hard to stay awake, you pass out and it’s 5pm and it all starts over again.

On some days, managing to get up at a decent time, do some morning hygiene and making it downstairs to see family; that can sometimes take every bit of power you can summon to achieve that and sometimes it’s too much. To then be greeted with “ah so you’ve decided to join the land of the living” or a similar level of sarcastic comment can completely wipe you out. “Why did I even bother...” is the first thought I tend to have, “...I should have just stayed in bed”.

So me and this woman got to chatting about what I went through and what I found worked for me or people I knew, and what touched me was that she was concerned for her daughter who was suffering big time and she was trying to find out what she could do to help. I gave her some pointers and spoke about what to avoid doing etc. If that is the **ONLY** thing that changed in the world from that seminar, then that’s a win to me.

That mother no longer has to feel alone or useless because she can’t make her daughter’s problem go away, because she doesn’t have the answers or tools to help and that is the most soul destroying thing as a parent, to know your kid is going through hell and you can’t help them. But she has something now, it might not work, but it’s a direction to go in and it’s a light in the dark.

I think it was Robin Williams who was credited with saying that depression is like being in a room full of people and feeling alone. A man of many faces who gave such joy to us on screen and who as most of you will know, sadly committed suicide a few years ago.

This is where I get heavily opinionated and I want to state that I am not going to suggest that the things I go on to mention will work for you, only that they are coping strategies and parts of my personality that have developed to help me deal with my mental load, stress and depression.

To open this segment, the most useful thing I learned was the ‘spoons’ metaphor. This comes in a couple of other variations I’ve heard of, such as ‘eggs in the box’ and ‘mana’ for the gamers.

Imagine you have a limited number of spoons per day, this number is not fixed and does not stay the same every day. It can change based on how well you slept, if you have eaten well, stayed hydrated, how much you did the day before or a traumatic event etc. Each task in a day, even the tiny ones, will use a certain number of your spoons up, and once you’ve used all the ones available to you, you’ll suffer tomorrow by borrowing spoons to do more.

I’ll happily detail an example in comments or do another detailed post if that helps, but I’m aware this post is reaching a ridiculous length. The main lesson to be drawn from it is that you have a limit you can do and that it changes each day and doing more than your limit will force you to borrow from tomorrow. This isn’t a set rule and lots of factors alter your numbers here, so it’s best to try and measure this yourself if you can - if that’s a struggle for you, I’ll help however I can.

The lesson taught me that it’s okay to say “I can’t do anymore today”, which is hard when you’re a perfectionist and you kick yourself for not doing what you expect of yourself and falling short of that standard. It taught me to prioritise things and to praise myself for achieving the smallest of things to others. I managed to shower today, that’s a win. Those dishes got done and I can eat now, that’s a win. It sounds **SUPER** demeaning at first if you’re cynically wired like me, but it works, it takes a little bit of pressure off.

Now this is all going to sound very tangential, I was talking about Robin Williams, spoons, where is this going? Please stay with me.

He was a man of many faces and the truth is we all are, most of us have three faces, we have a work face, a family and friends face and our own face. This won’t be news to most of you, but for those who do not know this I’ll explain.

Our work face is the mask we wear when we deal with everyone else in the outside world who isn’t a friend or family. It’s smiles and nice voice and reserved personality, but it takes a huge drain on your spoons. The family and friends face is a mask we wear when we socialise and spend quality time with those we love, we come out of our shell here, laugh, chill and have a good time sometimes, but we still aren’t transparent. Our own face is our true self, it doesn’t define who we are entirely, but when we take of those other masks, we are tired and can feel alone.

That’s the idea most of us stick to and I’m here to controversially say that it doesn’t have to be like that, because when I was in that mindset it became a trap. Admin, I beg of you to read what I have to say here and consider it before deciding on whether this stays or goes.

In my own life, not drawing from anyone else, articles, studies or ideology, this is not the way forward. You are not a sad person, you are a **person**, who experiences sadness. You are not a depressed person, you are a **person** suffering with depression. I am not one of these “you’ll get over it” types. I still suffer heavily with my depression, but I want to reassure you that you have a personality and it is not only comprised of depression.

My personality is a sarcastic, cynical, witty, tongue in cheek humour and laughter is the best medicine kind of guy. I spent years of my life using that as my mask. Thinking that I was still just this very sad and depressed person and that’s all I was. I would hold back from saying things I found funny because I was so anxious that people wouldn’t like me, that they’d be offended or find me odd and weird. But that **IS** me, I am weird, I am odd, I am funny (my friends and family will scoff at that), I am all of those things and that’s okay. You’re allowed to be those things.

In fact, I wouldn’t want to be anyone else. I spent years trying so damn hard to be likeable and to be normal and fit in. It made me so unhappy and stressed and anxious and I could never be me. Bit by bit in my life I’ve stepped away from it. I’ve done what I wanted to do and say what I wanted to say and put myself and my interests first and it has done wonders for me. I’ve not become selfish and ignorant, because there is a balance. But instead of putting myself last, I’ve put myself not last.

And the friends and family I love and who love me, I know that they are under no illusion of who I am and what I go through. I trust them to call me out on things, and I’d do the same for them. It has helped rid me of the anxiety of people saying they care about me and being friends with me when the do not know me. If you can be true to who you are, the things you like and find passion in, you’ll find people who will like and love you for who you are - and those who decide that who you are, is reason to stop being a part of your life, are not people you want to be around.

All of the stuff I’ve mentioned above that is controversial and heavily opinionated is not gospel, please do not think that this is the answer or the only way forward. I encourage you to find strength in believing in yourself and trying to accept who you are. I still have my off days too, days I wake up and hate myself for my faults, but I know I have them, they are a part of me I want to change and I try to work on them, and that’s enough to be proud of.

&lt;p&gt;Depression can be experienced differently and uniquely by each person, but overall there are some things that everyone who suffers with it can relate to and understand, no matter what end of the scale you’re on. It seldom comes alone, usually paired with anxiety of some kind, BPD, OCD or something like insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can be true to who you are, the things you like and find passion in, you’ll find people who will like and love you for who you are - and those who decide that who you are, is reason to stop being a part of your life, are not people you want to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stuff I’ve mentioned above that is controversial and heavily opinionated is not gospel, please do not think that this is the answer or the only way forward. I encourage you to find strength in believing in yourself and trying to accept who you are. I still have my off days too, days I wake up and hate myself for my faults, but I know I have them, they are a part of me I want to change and I try to work on them, and that’s enough to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU are allowed to be you. Keep fighting the good fight.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"hi. i am 17 and am feeling truly helpless at this point in my life. i have been going through severe depression on and off for about a year (the last 3 or 4 months id say were pretty solidly severe) and before that my episodes varied in range greatly but rarely ever had any gaps between them. this has been going on since about 12 or 13, getting worse over time.

last year my two siblings moved out on their own terms (we have an abusive father and parents have a toxic falling in-and-out relationship) and after years of my father denying going to therapy or getting help, he finally decided to let us (me and my parents) see a counsellor. both him and my mother barely went and have stopped going months ago after feeling like they were fine enough (though i disagree, their relationship is still very unhealthy).

i have been going to counselling/therapy for a year already and have had many talks / pleas from not only me but also my counsellor about taking me to a psychiatrist for my depression and anxiety. my parents said no.

they dont even want me to SEE if i need help, they dont want me to have any option at all to be diagnosed. i feel like it comes from misguidance about side effects of prescription antidepressants, but as much as both me and my counsellor have explained the misconceptions and logistics, my mother still won't let me go see a psychiatrist.

we started cbt a few months ago because of this, because my mother was / is convinced that i can simply use cbt to overcome my issues, and wants to see me ""try it out first"" like i can just pick either. the problem is, i usually struggle to follow the workbook or the application of learned tools when my body is physically off and tired, when i am procrastinatory and moody, etc. which i can't really snap out of just by ""willing myself"" to.

(this is because with severe depression, you usually need combination treatment to tackle that stubborn bitch.)

i'm not sure what to do? i want to ask again to see if i can at least try some natural supplements (st. john's wort, higher doses of L-theanine? [i have taken some before but not consistently / for depression, only during anxiety spirals / attacks] ) but i am afraid of even bringing it up.

i want to know if i would be able to get antidepressants by myself at this age? though i can't get a prescription currently, are there ways to get prozac or zoloft online? are there over the counter antidepressants that i can get without prescription that will do the job? genuinely looking for help / answers..google isn't my best friend here.

Now, there's this girl whom i've liked for quite a while, we went on a date once, we got to the point where we had sex and that was it, point is, we met two years ago by that point and i just recently started to like her, and she claimed to have feelings for me. Well, she didn't, and after the date she told me that she felt nothing at all and i felt... Used, manipulated, something like that so that she would have sex, i don't know.
Some months later i thought she started having feelings for me and got hurt again, but that one's on me.

Now, about a month ago or so, she just texted me again with a meme/pic saying ""How nice would it be to start off new year being with you"", kind of declaring that she had feelings for me. This time i was kind of... Afraid, because it had been bad for me the other times and i couldn't really tell if she was telling the truth or not, so i kind of tested her, turns out she is even more expressive than me when she likes someone (or so i thought) and, just yesterday we met again, i had decided that she was telling the truth and went for it. It was the best day of my life, we played that little table soccer thing, we watched ""My neighbor Totoro"", i cooked her for lunch and she loved it. We had sexual interaction (but did not get to the act as it is) We cuddled for about an hour until she had to leave,etc. I loved this day.

Well, whatever, she kind of blocked me from some social media, and has been ignoring my messages, when she responds she does it in a totally uninterested way. Like, all of a sudden all these feelings she claimed to have for me banished. Like she wants nothing from me anymore. And i feel used again, for her own pleasure or something. I know it has been little time after our date, but the change in her attitude is just so sudden and radical... I feel like she used me again, and i think i should ask her but... Man it just hurts so much... I actually thought this was going to be great, we have a lot of things in common, we always have something to talk about, something to do... I thought it would work...

Just why...
It doesn't help that i have a history of being really depressive and that i was in recovery, i was doing great but, i just fell all the way back and i'm fighting with myself, struggling to keep those suicidal thoughts away from me...

Then in the morning he wakes me up again doing the same things.

,depression_help,"Every morning my alarm rings at 6:30am, it does not feel like a reminder to wake up anymore, more like a reminder that I have to be awake for another painful day. I drag myself out of bed and feel zombish no matter how many hours of sleep I got because I can't remember the last time I felt fully rested. I get ready for school, head downstairs to once again not eat breakfast in the hope of slimming down. The mirror next to the door stares me down, judging me and my ugly body until I leave my house at 7:10 every morning. 

At this rate I can practically predict every time I feel social anxiety. People in their cars staring at me as I wait for the bus, getting on the bus makes me panic because the search for a seat can be the most dauting thing in the world. School has been gradually declining even if I've convinced my mum I'm getting all A's. I have no regard for the school rules anymore and I hate most of the people in my school, even if I have no reason to.

Fast forward, I get home, breathe a sigh of relief, probably recieve some shit from my mum and lie in bed scrolling through social media and feeling like shit because everyone seems to be way happier than me. Back to sleep and the cycle continues.

I would maybe tell my best friend about this but its hard to unload. I feel like all the joy has been sucked out of my life. Don't get me wrong I do have laughs, I do go out with friends and have fun, but theres always something wrong, like the happiness won't last and I'm just fooling myself.

I'm not sure what this is but I think this Macbeth quote better sums up my feelings:

One of my new mates confided in me about their parents abusing them and I haven't been able to distract myself from his story. It's so eerily similar to mine, but he called it abuse, which is a word I've never used. In a nutshell, my father's always been quite aggressive towards me. He calls me names that, as a kid, I couldn't repeat, and he uses anything and everything that upsets me against me. He's gotten physical a handful of times and he's threatened my life on five or six different occasions over the course of the last decade. It's always been this way though. Whenever we have a row, he reminds me that I deserve it and it's all my fault. It's always taken a hit on my self esteem, and it definitely distracted me from my school work. Sometimes I'd feel so upset at myself for all of it that self harm was a thought that crossed my mind (I never have followed through with it). I've always felt really low about myself though, so maybe I should've. Some nights I was afraid to sleep in my house.

Somehow I have managed myself to get help multiple times on my own - school counseler, private psychologist, hospitilised myself when I got obsessive thoughts of ending myself.

But now I feel like I am letting myself slowly deteriorate to death without me noticing.

I dont know how many of you have physical symptoms or get them and I dont care to explain it but I feel my body going.

My teeth are fucked because I just slighltly mange to brush them to remove morning breath.
I am developing ulcer (managed to go to dr to confirm it)
My spine is crooked for laying down on one side so much.
I have accidentally starved and dehydrated myself to the brink of passing out. On new years eve I almost got alcohol poisoning by just drinking 2 shots because I forgot to eat for 3 days.
My hair looks clean but I have curls so I can go on for 2 weeks not washing. And then I do it because I need to keep up appearnces.


Nobody understands how severe my depression is getting because I hide it so well.

Show up, small talk, complaine a little, make jokes and voila all worries from others diffused.

I stole my bfs benzos. Took 2 over a week because I felt so stressed. And then I didnt care anymore about the pills. He didnt notice. I live with him and he dont know.

Because I dont care to tell him and his grandfather died recently so he cant see.

I stopped my meds because I just couldnt call and ask for more.
Cant go to any drs anyomore because I dont care.

Health stuff is free here, I have money to skip waiting lines. My life is good. Own a starting business with good people, bought land, reletionship is nice with everyone and my depression decided to evolve to something sneaky.

If I dont have to do anything then I just lay on the couch. Thats it. Then bf comes home and I act that I care to watch and do stuff.

,depression_help,"I have been trying self help things for years and it has never done anything to help me and I’m to the point that I think I need to get on anti-depressants. The only problem with this is I have no idea how. Is it possible to ask a general practitioner about that? And besides that, I have barely any insurance under my parents insurance (I am 22) and they definitely would not let me go to the doctor for this, I’m not even allowed to go to a general practitioner. I go to a doctor maybe once every few years if I think something is really wrong. But I know if I tell them I need to go to a doctor for this they will not let me go and tell me to suck it up and deal with it, I’m sure their logic would be something along the lines of “you’ve made it this far you’ll be fine you don’t need to go to a doctor”. I went to them about anxiety once already and they told me I’m fine and to drop it, that I don’t need to go in to get help about it.

Right now I live alone and work part time in which I barely make enough money to live off of. I’m trying to find a full time job but haven’t even gotten an interview at all of the places I’ve applied. So basically if I went to a doctor I wouldn’t be able to afford it because our insurance covers almost nothing, and I especially don’t have any prescription coverage so I don’t even know if I could afford what I would need. I have not been diagnosis’s but I’m pretty sure I have anxiety and depression, possibly bipolar as well.

I’m at a loss here I really feel like it gets worse and worse every day and I just want to give up. I don’t know what to do. I’m hoping someone here was in a similar situation and might be able to help me in some way, like if you know if there is something I can do to get diagnosed and a prescription at a lower cost or how much it might cost me out of pocket to do all of this? I just don’t want my parents involved because I know they will get really mad at me for going to a doctor and getting help, which frustrates me endlessly. I’ve heard therapy is pretty expensive so I don’t think I want to try that, and my anxiety is so bad I know I would get nowhere going to a therapist because I can hardly vocalize what’s wrong the majority of the time.

I've started shutting people out of my life. I absolutely hate myself, I bite and pick my lips until I draw blood, I have zero actual friends, I feel uncomfortable in my own skin, and it all feels invalid. I find myself constantly insulting myself throughout the day, and although I'm fully aware of it and able to differentiate between positive and negative thoughts, it feels justified and more than deserved.

I don't cut myself. I have no diagnosis and don't plan on seeking one. I get straight A's and am on track to be valedictorian. Yet I feel awful every day. Friends of mine have had MDD and PTSD and  a c t u a l l y  used to cut. One of my friends is in an awful family situation that's far worse than mine. And after reading through some of these subreddits seeking advice, I've seen so many other posts from people who have it worse.

I feel like I don't deserve to talk to anyone about it. It seems so selfish and inconsiderate, especially considering how much better I probably have it than others. Like wah I hate myself, big deal, who cares. It's probably justified considering I have  z e r o  friends.

I've lost interest in my academics and my many extracurriculars. I used to have an unspoken drive and motivation to do everything, but now it just feels like another task to drag myself through in the process of surviving another day. The only reason I still maintain it all is because it's the standard I set and it's what others expect of me... I honestly feel powerless to change it, and I know dragging myself through it will be better in the long run.

I feel like I don't deserve to be loved. Someone made me tea and I cried because I felt like a jackass for making such a problem. I didn't even end up drinking it because I felt so undeserving. Even writing this is giving me a lump in my throat because I feel like such an absolute jackass.

I'm starting to feel like it's all so invalid. I deserve to have it worse. I deserve to hurt. I deserve to bear all the burdens others do before I get help because it's probably not even that bad. So many others cut and cry and die alone. Why do I deserve any better than them when they have it worse than I do. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel more and more ungrateful and hateful about myself with every passing day. What do I do?

     *TL;DR:
I hate myself, and I constantly insult myself as a result. I bite and pick my lips until I draw blood. I'm losing interest in activities and school.

I honestly feel powerless to change it, and I know dragging myself through it will be better in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve to be loved. Someone made me tea and I cried because I felt like a jackass for making such a problem. I didn&amp;#39;t even end up drinking it because I felt so undeserving. Even writing this is giving me a lump in my throat because I feel like such an absolute jackass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to feel like it&amp;#39;s all so invalid. I deserve to have it worse. I deserve to hurt. I deserve to bear all the burdens others do before I get help because it&amp;#39;s probably not even that bad. So many others cut and cry and die alone. Why do I deserve any better than them when they have it worse than I do. Maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong, but I feel more and more ungrateful and hateful about myself with every passing day. What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; *TL;DR:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself, and I constantly insult myself as a result. I bite and pick my lips until I draw blood. I&amp;#39;m losing interest in activities and school. I have no friends, and I don&amp;#39;t feel deserving of love or anything nice. I feel like I deserve any and all pain and suffering resulting from this, and I also feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve to talk about it considering the fact that I don&amp;#39;t have any diagnosis and so many people in my life and on this sub have it so much worse. What do I do?&lt;/p&gt;

And everything just keeps getting worse with no answers. So many tests, so many meds, nothing leads to anything. There is no relief, I can't do anything to escape it. And now I'm losing my reason to live, my art, to the pain.

Got sick at 23, now 25. I can't take much more. I almost pass out several times a week from pain now, my hands ache more every day, and I already have to contend with the constant head pain and hurting just trying to get around. 

I enjoy nothing anymore. I have to distract myself constantly just so I'm not alone with my own thoughts. I just want an end to this pain, I can't take it. I want it to stop. Nothing helps. My boyfriend is probably the only thing keeping me here. I love him so much and I'm so sorry he's stuck with the useless blob I've become. He's so supportive and I try so hard for him. I'm just so tired, everyone has limits. I want him to be happy, I'm so afraid I will only exhaust him. I grew up with a sick mother, I know what it's like caring for someone disabled. It's exhausting. If I keep degenerating like I am now, will I end up bedridden? Will I still be able to pretend sex doesn't hurt? Will I be able to even draw at all? What an I living for? What is the point of dreading every day, being in a endless cycle of pain and fear of tomorrow? 

I don't know how to be helped or if anyone even can. I guess I'm just getting closer to the edge and I'm scared. I was always a fighter, I pushed past my limits, pushed through everything. But I'm so tired, I'm losing my battle.",t2_2gsdqxxv,False,,0,False,I'm sick and I don't know how much more I can take.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_erm5n4,False,dark,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579593492.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know that anyone will see this or care, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

Depression is a bitch. It's not something you snap out of or get over. It's not just being in a bad mood for a day or two. It's pervasive and complicated and takes a unique approach of coping for every individual.

For a couple of months she has seemed more awkward less excited when going to gigs. We went to a show last night of a band she really loves, and she seemed uninterested / unhappy throughout the show.

Only reason im still here is because I havent figured out the logistical nightmare of erasing myself from this earth without being a hassle to anyone...

I'm not clinically diagnosed with depresion nor have I been in ""profesional"" help, I have been to a 4 day corse to help me deal with my dyslexia that also goes into psychological problems where I left only feeling worse about myself despite manging to break my habit of just bottling it up to myself but crying my eyes out infrond of 5 strangers and not being able to do 1/3 of the exercises because i just froze up or wasnt able to positively thing about myself wasnt really all that helpfull.

My recently ex gf has said she was willing to talk with me when I felt like this basically broken that promice 3 weeks later saying not to contact her ever again, only to contact me again a month later about a package that got lost in the mail, its out of her control and I am doing my hardest best to sort it out so she can get her stuff back, but she has been indirectly confirming she just hates my guts.   
My friends who I talk with regularly I have tried to share my troubles with but I have a pretty good jist that that my quantity of anxiatic filled rambelings only make them care less dho to Desensitization. so I tried to stop the day by day reports to only message them when I felt really really fucking fucked but this only increased the rate I slip backwards making me exactly the state i should message them but to scared to bother them because they probebly already thing of me as a attensionseaking depressed waste of space, which is true because I want to feel cared for and have friends that ""buddy check"" me every so othen because it feels like im just asking a room with my friends and aquenticence for a lisening ear but the room is loud, the words gets all jumbled up between my brain and mouth, not being able to leave my mouth because a slimeball is blocking my throat causing a travic jam of words and sentences. only to word vomit it all out without asking making some to discust or ghost me, others to go TLDR, others not beingable to make heads or talls from it and they just all leave the room with one giving me a mob with ""it's gone be oke"" writen on it and a bucket of ""stop worring about it"" in it.

,depression_help,"Hi all,

This is the first time I'm really opening up about my mental health. Please read to the end.

When I was 11, I started cutting for the first time. I got caught by my mom (duh... I was 11!) and she sent me to therapy. That was 6 years ago.

Last year I started cutting again. I was at a really low point in September, and my parents knew about it (not the s/h). We talked about therapy but it never went through. I started feeling better but not for long. I'm not sure what triggered everything, but I know I need help. I think I may have some form of undiagnosed depression (I feel apathetic, exhausted, self-hatred, overall sad, have thoughts of... you know... in depth, and I know it isn't drugs because I quit smoking weed). I don't want to be that b\*tch and self diagnose myself but I just want to feel happy and meaningful again (Side note, if you have anything to weigh in about that please do, let me know if I'm just overreacting).

I feel like I'm faking, because I still do my makeup, get dressed nicely, etc. but it's less because I want to and more because I'm expected to/I feel like I'm playing a role in a play. I don't enjoy being with my friends anymore either, even though I do want to be with them and have a kind of last hurrah for senior year. Most days I can't make it through. I don't know how to tell my parents that I still need help, and I definitely can't talk to them about the s/h. Does anyone have any advice on how I can ask for help without worrying them?

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I&amp;#39;m really opening up about my mental health. Please read to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 11, I started cutting for the first time. I got caught by my mom (duh... I was 11!) and she sent me to therapy. That was 6 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I started cutting again. I was at a really low point in September, and my parents knew about it (not the s/h). We talked about therapy but it never went through. I started feeling better but not for long. I&amp;#39;m not sure what triggered everything, but I know I need help. I think I may have some form of undiagnosed depression (I feel apathetic, exhausted, self-hatred, overall sad, have thoughts of... you know... in depth, and I know it isn&amp;#39;t drugs because I quit smoking weed). I don&amp;#39;t want to be that b*tch and self diagnose myself but I just want to feel happy and meaningful again (Side note, if you have anything to weigh in about that please do, let me know if I&amp;#39;m just overreacting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m faking, because I still do my makeup, get dressed nicely, etc. but it&amp;#39;s less because I want to and more because I&amp;#39;m expected to/I feel like I&amp;#39;m playing a role in a play. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy being with my friends anymore either, even though I do want to be with them and have a kind of last hurrah for senior year. Most days I can&amp;#39;t make it through. I don&amp;#39;t know how to tell my parents that I still need help, and I definitely can&amp;#39;t talk to them about the s/h. Does anyone have any advice on how I can ask for help without worrying them? And also, if/when I get help, should I tell them about the s/h? I know that I might have to be institutionalized (I was thinking about it and I would not mind going, I just don&amp;#39;t want to feel like this anymore). Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"Edit Title: Not Sure I Should Check Myself Into The Psych Hospital

I’ll put more details here tmmr since I’m really exhausted rn from existing

Alright so my depression has come back full force and I have trouble getting motivated to do schoolwork, going to school, waking up in the morning, taking care of myself, etc.

School stress has rlly taken a toll on me, especially the college process which I foolishly tried to mold my whole personality around for 3 years, trying to shape the perfect application without even consciously knowing it until the last minute. This sparked an identity crisis within me about a month ago, plus ever since my internship ended I’ve had trouble finding things to fill my time with as now my time is unstructured which leaves for risky room for my thoughts to ruminate and my control over my life to spiral out of control as I stay in my house all the time and just waste my time distracting myself with YouTube and Netflix.

Also I live in a conflicted household where every weekend my parents argue and this weekend it got rlly bad (not the first time) along the lines of threatening violence (not gonna say all the details on a public site). My parents have hated each other since I can remember and my dad is emotionally abusive. This has destroyed my mental health ever since I was 9 and I first wanted to die when I was 9.

I feel like this fact along with the school stress and college process questioning my inner values and my identity has led to my severe depression (it first rlly started in middle school, more details to be edited) coming back now.

Ok so my main question is, if I check into a psych hospital will it actually change anything or will I just return back home to the same messed up situation where my depression will come back anyway and nothing can help me or change my situation? 

Is it expensive to stay in a psych hospital?

Will they make me take all my clothes off to search for anything that I might harm myself with?

What about school? Will my grades suffer extremely and I’ll be stressed again trying to get them back up which may not even be a plausible thing to do?

And biggest question: Exactly what happens?

There’s so many things behind this post, but I’m trying to keep it short. I could write an essay or a book if I could but this is a Reddit post.

I really hate dealing with the authorities and I’m just scared of the possibility of dealing with CPS or any other authorities. My whole family will hate me for it, so thus my mental health will not get better

Also PS I’m not suicidal rn, I’m just rlly depressed and I need therapy but I feel like I need intensive services especially to get my family’s attention on how urgent this issue is",t2_mfa23,False,,0,False,Not sure if I check myself into the psych hospital,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'REQUESTING ADVICE'}]",r/depression_help,False,,,0,False,,t3_er8b0u,False,dark,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},REQUESTING ADVICE,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1579524812.0,richtext,,,,text,self.depression_help,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit Title: Not Sure I Should Check Myself Into The Psych Hospital&lt;/p&gt;

,depression_help,"I feel like I’m just passing by the minutes of my life. Sometimes almost as I’m watching myself and I can think consciously that I’m wasting precious time. 

I used to get up every morning when I had work and I would get myself ready, hair and makeup (even though I work in a call center and the customer never sees me) I felt good looking nice going to work everyday. 

One night at the end of August I woke up with a excruciating pain in my lower abdomen. So bad I almost called an ambulance. I have been sick since. I have been passed around to many different specialists and had countless tests and procedures. Turns out I have a bladder disease with no cure in site. I have to have a surgery this month to hopefully help with the bladder retention since I am relying on self catheterization. 

Now when the alarm goes off I dread the day ahead of me. I am filled with fear and anxiety. I am exhausted because even though I have slept I don’t feel like I have gotten any rest. It takes so much energy to shower. I no longer wear makeup. My eyebrows haven’t been groomed in 2 months. I only blow dry my hair. And I can no longer wear jeans or constricting pants due to the inflammation in my abdomen. I have missed work so much but thankfully I have doctors that have filled out the HR paperwork so that my job is currently secure. 

This past week was the worst it’s ever been.

Sometimes almost as I’m watching myself and I can think consciously that I’m wasting precious time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to get up every morning when I had work and I would get myself ready, hair and makeup (even though I work in a call center and the customer never sees me) I felt good looking nice going to work everyday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night at the end of August I woke up with a excruciating pain in my lower abdomen. So bad I almost called an ambulance. I have been sick since. I have been passed around to many different specialists and had countless tests and procedures. Turns out I have a bladder disease with no cure in site. I have to have a surgery this month to hopefully help with the bladder retention since I am relying on self catheterization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when the alarm goes off I dread the day ahead of me. I am filled with fear and anxiety. I am exhausted because even though I have slept I don’t feel like I have gotten any rest. It takes so much energy to shower. I no longer wear makeup. My eyebrows haven’t been groomed in 2 months. I only blow dry my hair. And I can no longer wear jeans or constricting pants due to the inflammation in my abdomen. I have missed work so much but thankfully I have doctors that have filled out the HR paperwork so that my job is currently secure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week was the worst it’s ever been. I have had days where I have stayed in bed and not showered but this past week I called in on Wednesday and Thursday (my days off are Friday and Saturday) I stayed in bed the entire time and didn’t shower until Saturday afternoon.

I have been struggling with depression for as long as I can remember. Some days are better than others, but lately, it's just been bad days. 

I have lost interest in writing, and I force myself to write for my blog in hopes of reaching out to others who have similar interests. 

I get unmotivated in my life, seeing how others have succeeded or have the life that I would have loved to experience. I start to wonder what I did wrong in mine. 

My SO and I have been having problems caused by his mother. We have come close to breaking things off twice. We have been together for almost four (4) years and have a two-year-old daughter. I simply can't handle the pressure that it puts on our relationship, and it's bringing up past issues that I have been trying to deal with for years. It also doesn't help that I keep having nightmares of confrontations with her.

,depression_help,"Over the past year or so has been shit to say the least. I have lost my grandfather on my dads side, and then my grandmother on my moms side. If that hadn't been hard enough, my mother was brought into the hospital for treatment for her on going issue with alcoholism, and needed to put her under to check her out, except she crashed when they did and was left on life support due to how bad her body was shutting down from years of abuse to drugs and alcohol. This broke me, but I figured I would be fine. A month later, my at the time GF of 5 years and i sat down and had a long talk, that resulted with us breaking up, it was civil and we have remained friends since. With this, I found it was super hard to live her her, let alone share a bed with her, and moved out after a month into my mothers old place. I did fine for about 5 weeks, but I just keep breaking down, overwhelmed with how quickly my life turned to shit. Ever since i moved out, i can feel myself getting deeper and deeper into this pit of sadness, but i have only friends online who do what they can. I've lost all interest in everything i loved, working out, singing, playing video games with my friends. My sleep schedule is all fucked and ill sleep for 14+ hours to not have to be awake. The only piece of happiness i have left, is the dog i got with my ex a year ago. She is my entire world, but i don't get to see her often and it kills me to leave when i do see her.

I've lost all hope for any goals and ambitions, they are still there and i have these ideas on how to get them but actually making then happen seems so out of reach. I work as a Call Company fire member at my local fire department but that only pays for calls i go on and its once a month, but has become impossible to do as i was on the Department with my ex and we used her car to get to calls. The only other car belongs to my brother that he uses for work, so I'm stuck home all the time.

My only hope, is when we sell my mothers old house and split the money, so i can get my own car, and work on my goals, but even that sounds like a fairy tale at this point. I'm just so lost, being a social guy, now alone. Someone who use to be proud of how he looks, now scared of a scale and mirrors. Once athletic, now i can barley run mile without passing out. I feel so broken, and I'm unsure how to fix myself, unsure if ill ever be happy.  I've tried explaining to others what i felt, but was brushed aside and told to ""man the fuck up, and just deal with it"". I'm tired of something small causing a full blown meltdown and breaking down over nothing because mentally I'm so worn out.

I moved to the US just a few months ago. I really wanted to move away from my home country so I was happy when this happened. I have lived in the US before so I thought it won't be challenging at all.

But it IS challenging. I got older than when I last lived in this country, so I neglected the fact that I changed! Just like how it's easier for a kid to learn a foreign language and harder for adults, now that I came back after I aged, everything feels just harder.

I didn't realize that moving to the US meant being deprived of all of them.

It’s a long story and I’m sure everyone reading this will think I’m weird.

So I think I’m probably gay but it’s been really weird and I’m not even sure. Years ago I started to feel that I don’t like my appearance and it almost feels like my brain or whatever desperately wants me to be in a different body, that is, the same gender as me of course. I always tell myself that it’s not okay but that’s not how really how your inner self work. 
The thing is, the change that I (for some reason) want is to get fat. It’s weird because I wasn’t really that skinny anyway. I always imagined as a kid that my soul was too big for my body, and I’m pretty sure as a teenager that’s definitely not the case.
I think about this more and more and it’s been bugging me for some time now. 
I have a friend who’s probably what that inner self (sorry idk what to call that inner voice that keeps bugging me) considers to be my ideal body. (I know it sounds creepy) I started to feel that I always wanted him to live better than me. 

**There is one thing to make clear: although I think I might be gay, I don’t necessarily “love” him, he’s just a good friend from my high school and we hang out a lot.**

He once broke his arm and, when I heard the news, I just snapped. I have broken my arm before and it wasn’t even that painful. But for some reason, that day when he broke his arm I feel so weird deeply that I don’t even know what that feeling is. I started to be very protective of him and it’s started to annoy him a bit. At first these thoughts seemed fine until recently when it started to drive me suicidal.
I get worried every time he goes to play basketball, skiing or whatever after that. It’s making anxious, and I can’t even tell him bc he will just think I’m weird and not believe in me. I know you would think none of this make sense, trust me, I think that too. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me and it’s just making me confused and terrified to face the future. It sure doesn’t sound serious but when you have to deal with these weird voices coming from nowhere, it’s a totally different story.
I just have to figure out a way to sort out this mess or it will likely keep bugging me until the day I finally decided to hang myself or whatever.

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post btw&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, 

I am recently been socializing with so many people. I have seen people in different states and I just feel negativity within me whenever I see someone in a bad situation. For example, 

1) a friend had horrible time getting money. He was almost homeless. He did really bad because he was unemployed by the time and no one was helping. Meantime I was around him, I felt that I am in his place. That I am in that desperate situation. Its so bad that I started to have low vibes around him and everyone. I started to focus on his energy to raise for me to even feel better about my situation, even though I was totally fine at the time. I started to have anxieties seeing myself in his shoes. It wasnt even helpful at all 

2) there is someone I am developing feelings for who is my neighbor. I flirt a bit with a it seems like she is neutral to it and not taking me seriously. I kissed and hugged her few times. Held hands. Walked and I even told her I missed her. Well, its unstable and maybe I am being a bit pushy. Anyway, today my friends were telling about a creepy guy at their room that is overwhelming them with attention and following them around. I immediately had low self confidence and thought perhaps my “crush” could think the same of me and say the same too?? 

3) I see few homeless people sleeping on the street and imagine myself in their place. I immediately have panic attacks of “what if” one day I am left alone to sleep on the street with no place to store my stuff, no bathroom, no place to go and be exposed to the public. But then I look the other direction and see all those other people that are living their lives and have homes. I literally look at the apartment buildings and ask myself: what are the chances, since the number of people having homes are much higher than the number of homeless people. Why should I be with that group? I literally dont drink, smoke, or mess around with my health not to end up in such bad situation. 

Please help me explain my intrusive thoughts thinking. I am being sensitive for others influence even if it has nothing to do with me. Low self esteem and believing in signs.

,depression_help,"I (22m) have recently discovered reddit. With the wonderful people and comments I see through many posts I think this is possibly the only place where I can actually reveal what is happening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in college trying to get into university in Canada. The goal is to go to MED school to be a doctor. The issue is I have my transcripts yet I shiver at the thought of uploading them. This has happened to me throughout my entire life. Applying to College to upgrade for Uni, studying for a test, trying to make friends, even thinking of leaving the house is all terrifying and crippling to the point where writing this I'm shaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

In high school I was admitted to the hospital because I shared with my Chaplain (Catholic School in Canada) that I was having suicidal thoughts and couldn't see any other option. The doctor who oversaw me said something about generalized anxiety but I'm not so sure since I held back a lot about what I was actually going through. When my parents found out my mother reacted by breaking down and Father by being confused and uncomfortable. My parents are kind and loving yet don't have the highest emotional intelligence.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since then I have patched my relationships with my parents and they think I'm fine. However I had a breakdown in front of my father. Parents are separated so only he knows. I showed him a small glimpse of my insecurities and he looked extremely uncomfortable. It was about how I feel disgusting and worthless over wasting time in my education and being a waste and strain to my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

The saddest part is this is only the tip of the iceberg; I've been trying to find cooping strategies and methods to improve my mental health but it's not working. At my worst I was having full blown hallucinations not knowing reality from fiction. For some reason they stopped after the hospital visit and I don't fell a need to take my life, yet I do think about it if I'm being honest. I know the advice will be to come out to my parents about this or to a friend but that is not an option. I would rather suffer in silence than hurt anyone with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've hidden this by using what I call my mask; a reflection of the ideal me that interacts with everyone so they won't suspect anything. I've done things and accomplished things that make my family proud and happy; yet all I fell is either shame, disgust, anger, or worst of all nothing about everything. For most of my life I've felt nothing, I'm somehow able to stuff it all in a corner in my mind and go numb.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this would be considered depression as I've never been diagnosed yet all I know is that I'm spiraling. I know life shouldn't be this way yet I know nothing else. I apologise if this is the wrong subreddit to post this but I need help. Thank you to whoever can help. And sorry for unloading this all on here.

I tried stoping ADs on my own a couple times and I went back deep into depression so I always ended up having to start taking ADs again, but I noticed that when off of meds, reaching orgasm was easy and normal.

Happiness is exhausting. Nothing is relaxing. Everything is just boring. I’m either angry or I’m numb. I don’t even take showers to feel clean anymore. I just take them so I can waste time and feel like I can go to bed sooner.

Here’s my problem. I don’t remember if I developed a personality before my depression took over. I don’t know if I was a real person as a child, or if I was just a puppet or something.

,depression_help,"Sorry if this isn't the best place to ask, I'm not exactly sure where to go.

In short, I'm a 19 year old who has been more-or-less socially isolated since around the age of 11, getting really bad at 14. I dropped out of highschool getting a GED at 16. At some point I tried community college but had a breakdown one or two days in and just never went back.

I isolated myself as a result of both anxiety and depression- I have never gotten professional help for it, and at the moment at least I can't expect to be able to. (I've tried recently)

My motivation has been about nothing this whole time, even when I've wanted ""desperately"" to have done something. In my isolation I have not developed any hobbies or skillsets, nor have I gotten a job or maintained any friendships. I can't drive. Put simply, I have no idea how to do anything. I admit that I'm incredibly lucky with not being kicked out of my room at this rate, but otherwise I can't rely on help or support from my family.

In my isolation my anxiety &amp; depression have worsened to horrible degrees and my social skills have atrophied from bad to shaking, turning red and stuttering for the most part. I can only describe going outside as feeling like I'm in a fever dream.

Apologies if this seems like just a whole lot of whining or disoriented- I've sat here for hours trying to figure out how to put things.

I've come to the understanding that living with my family is making my issues a lot worse, so I've tried to set ""get out"" as a personal goal, but every step I look at seems to be barred off by something I've never learned or just don't have the mental strength to push myself through right out of this stagnation.

I guess what I'm trying to ask for is like, just suggestions for easing out of this isolation &amp; stagnation? What can I do to start from here? I know ""one thing at a time"" but my eyes seem too muddied by the situation to even see those first few steps. I understand it's not going to be easy and things won't all come at once, I'm essentially trying to catch up on years upon years that I just *skipped* while hoping to become a person for what feels like the first time.

As a side note, though I don't expect help with this at all as I'm just voicing a silly concern, I'm hoping it's just anxiety but I'm worried that I've developed circulatory issues in all this time and that when things get ""better"" enough to address it everything will have been for not.

,depression_help,"hi all! 
Lately I’ve been lost. My existence is unimportant to me, and all I desire is to not live in my reality. There’s no more hope left inside of me. This is scary and I’m not sure how to escape it. Or if I can. 
Today, I felt as if I was watching myself live this pointless life. I forced myself to sleep for 12 hours, and once I awoke I couldn’t leave my bed. I haven’t looked at myself in the mirror today. Yes I’m on meds, and no I don’t really want help. I just want to know if it’s possible to continue a life I don’t want to have. 
Thanks

Lately I’ve been lost. My existence is unimportant to me, and all I desire is to not live in my reality. There’s no more hope left inside of me. This is scary and I’m not sure how to escape it. Or if I can. 
Today, I felt as if I was watching myself live this pointless life. I forced myself to sleep for 12 hours, and once I awoke I couldn’t leave my bed. I haven’t looked at myself in the mirror today. Yes I’m on meds, and no I don’t really want help. I just want to know if it’s possible to continue a life I don’t want to have. 
Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
