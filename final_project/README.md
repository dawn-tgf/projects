Final Project: ICU Mortality Prediction

## Problem Statement
Using data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient mortality


## The Need
Medical care is expensive, as we all know.   Medical resources is scarce.  Like in the recent Coronavirus situation, it has pushed hospital resources to the brink in some country.

Intensive Care Unit, or ICU for short, is a 24/7 staffed hospital department with highly specially-trained intensivists. Globally there is a shortage of ICU beds.  Better utilization of limited resources is very important. According to [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7800750_Daily_cost_of_an_intensive_care_unit_day_The_contribution_of_mechanical_ventilation). The mean intensive care unit cost and length of stay were $31,574 ± 42,570 and 14.4 days ± 15.8 for patients requiring mechanical ventilation $12,931 ± 20,569 and 8.5 days ± 10.5 for those not requiring mechanical ventilation.


## The Solution
Mortality prediction is a valuable information for the medical team to manage patients and resources.

 ## Conclusion

 The classifier is able to predict hospital mortality with an ROC_AUC score of 90%.
